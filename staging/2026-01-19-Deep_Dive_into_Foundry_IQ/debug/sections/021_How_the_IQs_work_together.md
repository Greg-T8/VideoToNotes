### 🎤 [00:35:15 – 00:37:43] How the IQs work together  
**Timestamp**: 00:35:15 – 00:37:43

**Key Concepts**  
- Progression from raw data → information → knowledge → wisdom  
- Knowledge bases as consolidated, contextualized, and interpreted data enabling reasoning  
- Different IQs (Foundry IQ, Fabric IQ, Work IQ) provide specialized knowledge domains  
- AI apps and agents leverage combined knowledge from multiple IQs to generate wisdom and make informed decisions  
- Integration of multiple IQs provides comprehensive understanding across user context, system operations, and organizational information  

**Definitions**  
- **Knowledge**: Data that has been consolidated, grouped, interpreted, and contextualized to enable reasoning.  
- **Wisdom**: The ability to make judgments and apply knowledge effectively.  
- **Foundry IQ**: Provides knowledge bases focused on organizational information.  
- **Fabric IQ**: Works with data in OneLake, mapping it to enterprise entities via ontologies to provide system operational knowledge.  
- **Work IQ**: Enhances data from M365 with memory, customization, and richer inferencing to provide user context knowledge.  

**Key Facts**  
- Knowledge bases enable high-quality inferencing and synthesis of answers by AI agents or apps.  
- Foundry IQ, Fabric IQ, and Work IQ each specialize in different data domains but collectively support AI applications.  
- AI apps and agents use these IQs together to access quality knowledge and provide wisdom for decision-making.  

**Examples**  
- Fabric IQ shortcuts to OneLake using ontologies to map data to real enterprise entities.  
- Work IQ adds memory and customization to M365 data for richer inferencing.  
- Combined use: Work IQ gives user context, Fabric IQ provides system operational knowledge, Foundry IQ offers organizational knowledge—together enabling AI to answer any question effectively.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- The value lies in combining multiple IQ knowledge bases to provide comprehensive, high-quality knowledge for AI applications.  
- Moving beyond raw data to knowledge and wisdom is essential for effective AI reasoning and decision-making.  
- Each IQ complements the others by focusing on different aspects of enterprise data and context.  
- AI apps and agents become more capable and accurate when leveraging integrated knowledge from all IQs.
