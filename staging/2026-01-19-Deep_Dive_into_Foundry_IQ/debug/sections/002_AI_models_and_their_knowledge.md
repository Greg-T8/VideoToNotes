### 🎤 [00:00:15 – 00:01:31] AI models and their knowledge  
**Timestamp**: 00:00:15 – 00:01:31

**Key Concepts**  
- AI models are trained on a fixed corpus of data, which forms their body of knowledge.  
- The training data includes books, websites, and transcripts.  
- The training dataset is finite and has a cutoff date; it excludes non-public information.  
- During training, the model’s neurons adjust weights and biases based on the data.  
- After training, the model generates responses by predicting the most probable next tokens.  
- To use information outside the pre-trained knowledge, it must be provided as part of the input prompt.

**Definitions**  
- **Corpus of training data**: The complete set of text data (books, websites, transcripts) used to train the AI model.  
- **Generative model**: An AI model that produces text by predicting the next most probable token based on learned patterns.  
- **Weights and biases**: Parameters within the neural network adjusted during training to capture relationships in the data.

**Key Facts**  
- The training data is finite and has a cutoff date, meaning it does not include any information published after that date.  
- Non-public information is not included in the training data.  
- The model generates responses token-by-token based on probability predictions.

**Examples**  
- None explicitly mentioned, but the process of providing additional data as part of a prompt is implied as a practical approach.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- AI models rely solely on their pre-trained knowledge and cannot access new or private information unless explicitly provided during a request.  
- Understanding the limitations of the training data (finite size, cutoff date, public-only) is crucial when using AI models.  
- To extend the model’s capabilities beyond its training, external information must be included in the prompt or request.
