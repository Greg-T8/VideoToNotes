### 🎤 [00:00:00 – 00:00:15] Introduction  
**Timestamp**: 00:00:00 – 00:00:15

**Key Concepts**  
- Training data corpus as the foundational knowledge base for the model  
- The training data is sourced from books, websites, and transcripts  
- The model is generative and predicts the next most probable token based on training  

**Definitions**  
- **Corpus of training data**: A finite collection of text data used to train the model, consisting of publicly available sources up to a certain cutoff date  
- **Generative model**: A model that generates responses by predicting the next most probable token in a sequence  

**Key Facts**  
- Training data is finite and has a cutoff date  
- Non-public information is not included in the training data  
- Model training involves adjusting weights and biases of neurons based on connection strengths  

**Examples**  
- None mentioned explicitly in this segment  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- The model’s knowledge is limited to its training corpus, which is finite and time-bound  
- The generative model functions by predicting tokens sequentially to produce responses  
- Understanding the source and limitations of training data is crucial to grasping model capabilities and constraints
