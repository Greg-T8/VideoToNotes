### 🎤 [00:09:03 – 00:09:32] Agentic RAG  
**Timestamp**: 00:09:03 – 00:09:32

**Key Concepts**  
- Transition from single-shot RAG to agentic RAG  
- Agentic RAG supports multi-hop retrieval  
- Ability to search across multiple knowledge sources simultaneously  

**Definitions**  
- **Agentic RAG**: An advanced retrieval-augmented generation approach that goes beyond a single query to one index by enabling multi-hop searches across multiple knowledge sources in a single request.

**Key Facts**  
- Unlike single-shot RAG, which queries one index per request, agentic RAG can query multiple indexes  
- Enables grouping of different knowledge sources to be searched together  

**Examples**  
- Searching index one and index two simultaneously to gather applicable information related to a real-world entity, relationship, or constraint  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Agentic RAG enhances knowledge retrieval by integrating multiple sources in one query  
- This approach provides a more comprehensive and connected knowledge layer rather than isolated information retrieval  
- Useful for scenarios where relevant data spans across different indexes or knowledge bases
