### 🎤 [00:17:46 – 00:18:49] Collections of knowledge sources  
**Timestamp**: 00:17:46 – 00:18:49

**Key Concepts**  
- A knowledge base is a collection of multiple knowledge sources grouped together.  
- Knowledge sources can be reused across different knowledge bases.  
- AI apps or agents interact with knowledge bases rather than individual knowledge sources.  
- This abstraction simplifies querying multiple disparate data stores.  
- The system enables richer and more unified search results across all knowledge sources in a knowledge base.

**Definitions**  
- **Knowledge Source**: An individual repository or data set containing specific knowledge or information.  
- **Knowledge Base**: A collection of knowledge sources combined to represent useful knowledge about entities or topics relevant to an enterprise or application.

**Key Facts**  
- Different SKUs support different numbers of knowledge sources (e.g., Basic SKU supports 15 knowledge sources unless created earlier).  
- Previously, agents had to query multiple separate data stores (e.g., blobs, SharePoint) individually and merge results manually.  
- Now, AI apps can simply point to a knowledge base to retrieve all relevant information without managing separate queries.

**Examples**  
- None explicitly mentioned, but implied examples include querying across blobs, policies, and SharePoint documents consolidated into a single knowledge base.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Knowledge bases abstract away the complexity of managing multiple knowledge sources.  
- AI applications benefit by querying a single knowledge base rather than multiple disparate sources.  
- This approach leads to cleaner, more efficient data retrieval and richer search capabilities.  
- Reusability of knowledge sources across knowledge bases enhances flexibility and organization.
