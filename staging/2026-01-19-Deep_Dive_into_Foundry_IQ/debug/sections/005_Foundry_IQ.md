### 🎤 [00:08:24 – 00:09:03] Foundry IQ  
**Timestamp**: 00:08:24 – 00:09:03

**Key Concepts**  
- Foundry IQ is built on Azure AI Search but extends its capabilities.  
- It provides a true knowledge layer rather than just an information layer.  
- Moves beyond single-shot Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to agentic RAG.  
- Supports multi-hop querying across multiple knowledge sources instead of a single index.

**Definitions**  
- **Foundry IQ**: An enhanced search capability built on Azure AI Search that enables multi-source, agentic retrieval and knowledge integration rather than simple single-index information retrieval.  
- **Agentic RAG**: A retrieval approach that allows multi-hop queries and interaction across multiple knowledge sources, as opposed to single-shot RAG which queries only one information source.

**Key Facts**  
- Traditional RAG 1.0 stacks query a single index representing a single information source.  
- Foundry IQ enables searching across more than one knowledge source in a single request.

**Examples**  
- Instead of querying just index one, Foundry IQ can query index one and index two simultaneously to gather applicable information related to real-world entities, relationships, or constraints.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Foundry IQ represents a significant evolution from single-source search to a multi-source, knowledge-driven search layer.  
- It enables more complex, agentic retrieval scenarios that better reflect real-world information needs.  
- This multi-hop capability allows integration of diverse data sources in one query, improving the relevance and completeness of results.
