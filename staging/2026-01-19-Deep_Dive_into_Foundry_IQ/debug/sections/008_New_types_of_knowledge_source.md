### 🎤 [00:10:18 – 00:11:55] New types of knowledge source  
**Timestamp**: 00:10:18 – 00:11:55

**Key Concepts**  
- Expansion of knowledge sources to include new types beyond traditional data stores  
- Integration of semantic ontologies to add meaning to enterprise data  
- Indexing of both local and remote knowledge sources for AI search  
- Use of semantic indexing to improve relevance of information retrieval  

**Definitions**  
- **Fabric IQ**: Fabric’s ontology of enterprise entities, relationships, and properties that provides semantic meaning to the data stored in OneLake.  
- **Knowledge Source**: A data repository or system that can be indexed and searched by AI tools to retrieve relevant information.  

**Key Facts**  
- Knowledge sources now include data in Fabrics OneLake and Fabric IQ ontology models.  
- SharePoint sites can be individually indexed as knowledge sources, creating local indexes with embeddings and vectors.  
- Remote knowledge sources are supported, such as Work IQ or M365 SharePoint, which use Microsoft 365’s semantic index.  
- Access to M365 semantic index requires a Copilot license.  
- Additional remote sources include web search powered by Bing and preview access to MCP (a standard for providing knowledge, tools, and prompts to AI applications).  

**Examples**  
- Indexing a specific SharePoint site to create a local AI search index.  
- Using M365 SharePoint semantic index to find relevant information based on the user’s token.  
- Making AI requests to the web via Bing.  
- Preview capability to point to MCP for enhanced AI knowledge and tooling.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- The concept of knowledge sources is broadening to include semantic models and remote indexes, enhancing AI’s understanding and retrieval capabilities.  
- Fabric IQ adds enterprise semantic context, making data more meaningful and useful.  
- Both local and remote knowledge sources can be integrated into AI search workflows.  
- Licensing (e.g., Copilot) may be required to access certain semantic indexes.  
- The system supports flexible knowledge integration, including web and standardized AI knowledge platforms like MCP.
