### 🎤 [00:09:32 – 00:10:18] Multiple knowledge sources  
**Timestamp**: 00:09:32 – 00:10:18

**Key Concepts**  
- Searching across multiple knowledge sources simultaneously (multi-hop retrieval).  
- Grouping different knowledge sources to perform combined searches.  
- Adding new types of knowledge sources beyond traditional indexes.  

**Definitions**  
- **Knowledge sources**: Distinct repositories or indexes of data that can be searched to retrieve relevant information.  
- **Multi-hop retrieval**: The process of querying multiple knowledge sources or indexes in a single request to gather comprehensive information.  

**Key Facts**  
- It is possible to search across multiple indexes (e.g., index one and index two) within a single query.  
- Grouping knowledge sources enables more complete and relevant search results by considering different types of data related to entities, relationships, or constraints.  
- New knowledge sources can include data indexed from Fabrics OneLake and Fabric IQ.  
- Fabric IQ represents an ontology of enterprise entities, relationships, and properties, adding semantic meaning to the data.  

**Examples**  
- Searching both index one and index two to retrieve applicable information related to a real-world entity or relationship.  
- Including Fabric IQ as a knowledge source to leverage enterprise ontology for more meaningful search results.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Moving beyond single-index search to multi-hop, multi-source retrieval enhances the depth and relevance of information found.  
- Incorporating semantic models like Fabric IQ enriches the understanding of enterprise data beyond raw information.  
- The concept of knowledge sources is expanding to include diverse data types and semantic layers, improving the utility of search and retrieval systems.
