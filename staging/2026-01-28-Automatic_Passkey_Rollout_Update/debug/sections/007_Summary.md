### 🎤 [00:09:54 – 00:10:23] Summary  
**Timestamp**: 00:09:54 – 00:10:23

**Key Concepts**  
- Passkeys offer superior security compared to traditional methods.  
- Passkeys will be enabled as an option for all users while maintaining existing configurations.  
- Configuration flexibility allows for granular control over who gets device-bound or synced passkeys.  

**Definitions**  
- **Passkeys**: A modern authentication method that enhances security by replacing passwords with cryptographic keys.  
- **Device bound**: Passkeys that are tied specifically to a user’s device, often used for sensitive users.  
- **Synced passkeys**: Passkeys that are synchronized across devices, suitable for general or task-based users.  

**Key Facts**  
- Enabling synced passkeys depends on current attestation settings:  
  - If attestation is enabled, synced passkeys are not automatically enabled.  
  - If attestation is not enabled, synced passkeys will be enabled by default.  
- Administrators can review and adjust passkey settings per tenant after enablement.  

**Examples**  
- Device-bound passkeys can be assigned to sensitive users.  
- Synced passkeys can be enabled for general or task-based workers.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Passkeys improve security and are now available as an optional feature without disrupting existing setups.  
- Admins have granular control to tailor passkey deployment based on user roles and sensitivity.  
- Review official documentation in the message center for detailed configuration guidance.  
- This update aims to provide flexibility and enhanced security simultaneously.
