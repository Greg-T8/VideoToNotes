**Timestamp**: 00:00:00 – 00:00:13

**Key Concepts**  
- Phishing resistance in authentication methods  
- Requirement of proximity for authentication  

**Definitions**  
- **Phishing resistant**: Authentication methods that prevent attackers from tricking users into revealing credentials.  

**Key Facts**  
- Authentication requires the passkey device to be physically near the authenticating device.  
- Proximity is established via Bluetooth, NFC, or USB connections.  

**Examples**  
- Using a passkey stored on a phone that must be within range of the device being authenticated.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Proximity-based authentication enhances security by making phishing attacks ineffective.  
- Devices must be physically close to each other to complete authentication, leveraging technologies like Bluetooth, NFC, or USB.
