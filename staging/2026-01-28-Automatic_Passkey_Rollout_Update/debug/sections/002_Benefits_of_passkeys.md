### 🎤 [00:00:13 – 00:01:39] Benefits of passkeys  
**Timestamp**: 00:00:13 – 00:01:39

**Key Concepts**  
- Passkeys provide phishing resistance through multiple mechanisms.  
- Passkeys require physical proximity between the authenticating device and the device holding the passkey.  
- Passkeys validate the domain name to ensure authentication is only done on the correct site.  
- Passkeys offer fast and strong authentication.  

**Definitions**  
- **Passkey**: A credential stored on a device (e.g., phone) used for authentication that requires proximity and domain validation to prevent phishing.  

**Key Facts**  
- Proximity is enforced via Bluetooth, NFC, or USB connections.  
- Passkeys prevent users from being tricked into authenticating fraudulent domains (e.g., "Microsoft.com" vs. "micro five of.com").  
- Passkeys help protect users from phishing attacks by validating the domain and requiring physical device presence.  

**Examples**  
- A passkey stored on a phone must be within range of the authenticating device to work.  
- The passkey for "Microsoft.com" cannot be used on a fake domain like "micro five of.com."  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Passkeys significantly reduce phishing risks by requiring device proximity and domain validation.  
- They provide a fast and strong form of authentication.  
- Users cannot be easily tricked into giving credentials to malicious actors posing as legitimate services.
