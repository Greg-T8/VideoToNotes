1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,200
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:11,760
In this video, I want to quickly cover what this message you're seeing in your tenant around auto-enabling passkey profiles means to you and what you may need to do.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,520
I think for most of us, we understand the benefits of passkeys today.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:29,680
So when I think about this passkey, this cryptographic mechanism gives us a lot of benefits for the end users and then the security of our services, our applications.

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,560
One of the huge things is they are phishing resistant because of a number of different things.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,840
They require proximity.

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:52,400
So I've got my passkey that says on my phone or whatever, the device I'm authenticating with that passkey has to be within range of the device via Bluetooth or NFC or even USB.

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,920
So, the user can't be tricked to authenticating some bad actor that's trying to pretend they're a help desk or anything else.

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:09,600
Also, it's going to validate that the domain name you're trying to use the passkey against is the right domain name.

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,480
So, the passkey is for Microsoft.com.

11
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:21,040
I can't be tricked to try and use it for micro five of.com or some RN instead of the M.

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,680
So I can't be tricked to using it against another site that's trying to grab a token, the credential and then use it in a bad way.

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,560
And they're also actually very fast in terms of the authentication.

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,200
So it's very strong authentication and it helps protect the users from those types of phishing interactions.

15
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:47,440
Now, I did a video a few weeks ago on synced passkeys and their support now in Entra.

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:55,600
And what this message is all about is about that support for synced passkeys rolling out, so they will be available to all of the tenants.

17
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,720
Now, what we had before in Entra was the idea of device bound.

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,440
Now that device bound meant, hey, it was part of a USB dongle, for example, as part of a FIDO2.

19
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,720
It could have been part of the authenticator app.

20
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:22,560
So the authenticator app on your phone could have a passkey, but the passkey was only present on that particular phone.

21
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,440
It wouldn't go and sync to your other devices.

22
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,320
And also I could do something called attestation.

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:42,400
So the attestation would say, actually, not only do I have this passkey, but it's cryptographically signed through the hardware of the device through to a root signing certificate from FIDO2 that you can trust this.

24
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,280
But then also we have this idea of synced passkeys.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,200
And what that will do is within a certain ecosystem, so for example, within my Apple

26
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,080
ecosystem or within my Android ecosystem, it could sync.

27
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,040
So all my iPhones, my iPads, my Mac machines could have the same passkey.

28
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,840
I just create it once and it's available on all of them.

29
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:18,480
Or on all my Android devices or hey, I'm using the Chrome, it would be available there, but it would not sync across ecosystems.

30
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,480
So it made it a bit more user-friendly.

31
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,480
And obviously I could create multiple passkeys, one on Apple, one on Android.

32
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,680
I could absolutely do that.

33
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,880
So these are more consumer-friendly because now they're just available.

34
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,680
There's less chance I lose it because it's hard linked to a certain piece of hardware.

35
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:46,800
Now with synced, you cannot do that attestation because there is no agreed upon standard on, hey, how can a key be attestation approved and guaranteed?

36
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,280
if it could be on many different parts of hardware.

37
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,200
So you don't have attestation.

38
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,240
And one thing I do want to stress, remember the pass keys are really all about how I would authenticate.

39
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:07,840
So this is all about the auth N, so the authentication, proving I am who I say I am, and it's very strong authentication.

40
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,640
But you still then have the layout of authorization.

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,560
So we think about, for example, conditional access in Entra, which can then check for other things.

42
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:30,240
So even if the passkey was synced on many devices, well, my conditional access policy could say, hey, yeah, I want a strong credential, but I also want it to be a managed device, for example.

43
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,320
It's managed by Intune.

44
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,200
It's healthy.

45
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,480
So just because the passkey exists doesn't mean it can just be used on any of the different services.

46
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,120
The passkey strength is just one factor I can use as part of my conditional access.

47
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,120
Okay, so what is changing?

48
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,280
So in preview before, when I did the video, you now had this ability to support synced passkeys.

49
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,880
And the way you did that is you could create passkey profiles.

50
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:06,680
And the passkey profile would let you pick, hey, do I want device bound and or do I want synced and do I want attestation required?

51
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,560
Now if you do attestation required, you can't do synced within the profile.

52
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:22,720
And so what's happening here is your current settings will control what this new default passkey profile that is going to be established will contain.

53
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,400
So the whole goal here, and let's look at the article for a second, and it's telling us exactly what it's going to do.

54
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:38,720
So the whole point here is whatever you currently have configured for your just FIDO2 authentication method,

55
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:46,400
which really today you can put in, do you want attestation or not, will drive what the default passkey profile will be.

56
00:05:48,880 --> 00:06:06,160
So what that's going to do is if you have attestation, it tells you about the timing down here for just general worldwide, it's basically in the month of March, and then the automatic enablement will happen April through May.

57
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,320
For the GCC, GCC hire DoD, the enablement is in the month of April and then automatic rollout in June.

58
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:31,520
And what it's going to do is we can see here, depending on your configuration, if you currently have attestation enabled, then it's only going to allow device bound.

59
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:39,760
If you don't have attestation enabled, or it's disabled, then it's going to let you have device bound and synced.

60
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,960
Any targeting you have will be set as part of the assignment to the default passkey profile.

61
00:06:47,520 --> 00:07:01,600
So if we only focus on that for now, what that means is if we go into our authentication methods, so I'm looking at authentication methods under entry ID, and then looking at policies,

62
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,360
Once this is enabled, we see we now have this passkey FIDO2.

63
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,920
And what you're going to now see is, firstly, this enablement is going to disappear because it will just be enabled for everyone.

64
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,280
I'm signed in early.

65
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,680
But you're going to have now this default passkey profile.

66
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:29,840
And again, if you have attestation currently enabled for the old FIDO2, then you're only going to have device bound because you cannot have synced.

67
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,200
If you did not have attestation, then it's going to have device bound and synced.

68
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,160
That's really the whole thing of what it's going to do.

69
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,520
And also it will honor any other sort of behaviors, any AA GUID you have configured on there.

70
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:56,320
And then if you've targeted particular groups for the existing configuration, well, then they're going to be targeted for that default profile.

71
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,880
And of course, the whole goal of the profiles is I can actually have multiple profiles.

72
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,360
So for example, I also have a synced passkey profile that I'm only targeting for certain groups.

73
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:14,160
So hey, the device bound is everyone, but the synced one I'm allowing for specific groups of people.

74
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,160
So that's the behavior.

75
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:22,000
And obviously, once it's enabled for your tenant, you could go and start creating these and refining them early.

76
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,520
That's totally up to you.

77
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,840
So the other change,

78
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,600
if we go and look, is the idea of the registration campaign.

79
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,560
So right now, if you've got the registration campaign, it kind of targets SMS messages or phone calls.

80
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,360
Well, it's going to change that to go ahead and use passkeys.

81
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,520
So if I'm only using device bound, it's going to be Microsoft Authenticator.

82
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,960
If I have sync available, then it's going to use passkeys.

83
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,280
which is synced as well.

84
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,360
So I can see that as well.

85
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,280
So under my authentication methods, you have the registration campaign.

86
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,840
And all it's going to do is if it's enabled or Microsoft managed, you're going to see it go ahead.

87
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,320
And the method, if you have synced, will change to passkeys.

88
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,800
If it's device banned, it will just stay as authenticator.

89
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
If you've disabled it, then it will stay disabled.

90
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,640
It won't do anything.

91
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
But that's really all it's doing.

92
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,880
So the whole goal here is passkeys are very much superior when we think about the security.

93
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,720
And so what they're going to do is enable them now for everyone as a choice.

94
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,400
It's going to maintain your existing configuration.

95
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,440
So if today, hey, I want that attestation, it's not going to go ahead and enable sync passkeys for you.

96
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,360
If you're not doing attestation, then it will enable sync passkeys because it's really equivalent to that type of thing.

97
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,440
But what you can do now is be aware.

98
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,000
Once it's enabled for your tenant, you can go and have a look at the configuration.

99
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You can tweak things.

100
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,920
Maybe if I want that device bound for maybe sensitive users, I can do that.

101
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,320
And then enabled synced for the more general task-based workers and everything else.

102
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,400
So that's the change.

103
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,840
You can go and read the full document in the message center.

104
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,920
Hope that clears it up.

105
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,160
It's going to maintain your configuration and just

106
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,160
Hey, now you'll have access to be more granular in who should have device bound and or synced.

107
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,160
Till the next video, take care.
