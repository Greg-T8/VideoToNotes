### 🎤 [03:37:25 – 03:42:34] AKS  
**Timestamp**: 03:37:25 – 03:42:34

**Key Concepts**  
- Kubernetes as the de facto container orchestrator  
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as Azure’s managed Kubernetes offering  
- AKS architecture: control plane (management layer) and node pools (worker nodes)  
- Pods as the smallest deployable units running containers  
- Persistent storage integration via Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) and Persistent Volumes (PVs)  
- Networking models in AKS: Kubenet, Azure CNI, and Overlay networking  
- Scaling in AKS at two levels: pods and nodes  
- Autoscaling tools: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, KEDA (Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaler), and Cluster Autoscaler  
- Bursting capacity to Azure Container Instances (ACI) via virtual kubelet  

**Definitions**  
- **Kubernetes**: An open-source container orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.  
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: A managed Kubernetes service in Azure that abstracts the control plane and simplifies cluster management.  
- **Control Plane**: The management layer of Kubernetes that runs components like the API server, scheduler, ETCD database, and controllers.  
- **Node Pool**: A group of virtual machine nodes in AKS that run the container workloads.  
- **Pod**: The smallest Kubernetes object that encapsulates one or more containers running together.  
- **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**: A request for storage by a pod that maps to a Persistent Volume (PV).  
- **Kubenet**: A basic AKS networking model using a separate IP space for pods with NAT for communication.  
- **Azure CNI**: A networking model where pods share the same IP space as nodes or use a dynamic subnet allocation.  
- **Overlay Networking**: A preferred networking model using a separate CIDR range for pods with native communication plumbing, avoiding Kubenet limitations.  
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**: Automatically scales the number of pod instances based on workload metrics.  
- **KEDA**: An advanced event-driven autoscaler for Kubernetes pods with more flexible scaling triggers.  
- **Cluster Autoscaler**: Automatically adds or removes nodes in the cluster based on pod scheduling needs.  
- **Virtual Kubelet**: A connector that allows AKS to burst workloads to Azure Container Instances seamlessly.  

**Key Facts**  
- AKS control plane components include API server, ETCD database, scheduler, and controllers, all managed by Azure (not visible to users).  
- Node pools run on virtual machine scale sets within the user’s Azure subscription.  
- Persistent storage options include Azure Files, Azure NetApp Files, Azure Disks, Elastic SAN, and Azure Container Storage.  
- Kubenet requires NAT and has a separate IP space for pods, making it less popular.  
- Azure CNI pods share the node IP space or use dynamic subnet allocation to avoid IP exhaustion.  
- Overlay networking is now the preferred AKS networking model for better scalability and fewer issues.  
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and KEDA handle pod-level scaling; Cluster Autoscaler manages node-level scaling.  
- AKS can burst to Azure Container Instances using virtual kubelet for short-term capacity needs.  

**Examples**  
- Using persistent volume claims to connect pods to durable storage like Azure Files or Azure Disks.  
- Bursting cluster capacity to Azure Container Instances via virtual kubelet for short-term demand spikes.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- AKS simplifies Kubernetes management by handling the control plane and providing node pools for workload execution.  
- Understanding AKS networking models is crucial for designing scalable and efficient clusters; overlay networking is currently preferred.  
- Scaling in AKS is multi-dimensional: pods scale horizontally based on demand, and nodes scale automatically to accommodate pod scheduling.  
- Integration with Azure storage services provides persistent storage options for stateful applications.  
- Virtual kubelet enables flexible bursting to serverless container instances, enhancing cluster elasticity.
