### 🎤 [00:15:51 – 00:18:57] Groups  
**Timestamp**: 00:15:51 – 00:18:57

**Key Concepts**  
- Managing permissions and licenses is more efficient when done via groups rather than individual users or devices.  
- Groups can contain users or devices and are used to assign roles, permissions, and licenses collectively.  
- There are two main types of groups: Security groups and Microsoft 365 groups.  
- Group membership can be assigned either directly (manual selection) or dynamically (based on rules).  
- Dynamic groups automatically update membership based on attributes like department, job title, or hire date.  
- Groups simplify administration by reducing the risk of leftover permissions or licenses on individual accounts.

**Definitions**  
- **Security Group**: A group type primarily used to assign roles and permissions within the system.  
- **Microsoft 365 Group**: A group type used for collaboration tools such as calendars, SharePoint, and other Microsoft 365 services.  
- **Dynamic Group**: A group whose membership is automatically managed based on defined rules and attributes (e.g., job title, department).  
- **Direct Membership**: Group membership assigned by explicitly selecting users or devices.

**Key Facts**  
- Dynamic membership rules can include conditions like display name contains certain text, department, job title, or hire date.  
- Example dynamic group: users hired within the last 30 days.  
- Another example: devices like iOS devices grouped dynamically.  
- Groups can be assigned licenses, roles, and applications, making them the preferred method for managing access and permissions.

**Examples**  
- A dynamic security group with a membership rule where the job title matches "hero*" (e.g., hero or heroine).  
- A dynamic group including users hired within the last 30 days.  
- A dynamic group for iOS devices.  
- A group named "Justice League" with dynamic membership rules.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Use groups to manage permissions and licenses instead of assigning them individually to users or devices.  
- Prefer dynamic groups when possible to automate membership management and reduce administrative overhead.  
- Understand the difference between Security groups (for roles/permissions) and Microsoft 365 groups (for collaboration).  
- Leverage attributes like job title, department, and hire date to define dynamic group membership rules.  
- Assign licenses, roles, and application access at the group level for streamlined management.
