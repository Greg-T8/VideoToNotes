### 🎤 [01:09:28 – 01:10:15] Networking  
**Timestamp**: 01:09:28 – 01:10:15

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure networking fundamentals  
- Cost model for data transfer in Azure (ingress vs egress)  
- Virtual Network (VNet) as the basic building block of Azure networking  
- Boundaries of a virtual network in terms of subscription and region  

**Definitions**  
- **Ingress**: Data coming into Azure from outside (no cost)  
- **Egress**: Data leaving Azure data centers (cost incurred)  
- **Virtual Network (VNet)**: A logically isolated network within Azure that exists within a specific subscription and region  

**Key Facts**  
- Azure does not charge for ingress data (data entering Azure)  
- Azure charges for egress data (data leaving Azure data centers)  
- A virtual network is confined to a single subscription and a single Azure region  
- VNets cannot span multiple subscriptions or regions  

**Examples**  
- None mentioned explicitly, but the speaker references a virtual network named "VNet one" as an example  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always remember that ingress data into Azure is free, but egress data is chargeable  
- Virtual networks are fundamental to Azure networking and are scoped to a single subscription and region  
- Understanding the boundaries of VNets is crucial for network design and management in Azure  
- For deeper networking knowledge, consider resources like the AZ-700 study cram
