### 🎤 [00:20:48 – 00:23:27] Licenses  
**Timestamp**: 00:20:48 – 00:23:27

**Key Concepts**  
- Entra licenses are assigned at a per-user level, not necessarily uniform across the tenant.  
- Different license tiers provide varying levels of functionality.  
- Entra ID licenses often come bundled with other Microsoft licenses (e.g., Microsoft 365 E3/E5).  
- There are three main license levels: base, P1, and P2, plus a governance add-on.  
- Governance add-on includes lifecycle workflows and enhanced audit/reporting capabilities.  
- P1 license includes key features like conditional access and self-service password reset with write-back for hybrid identity.  
- P2 license adds advanced features such as privileged identity management, core access reviews, and identity protection.  
- License assignment can be tailored based on user roles and needs (e.g., privileged users get P2, basic workers get P1).  
- Self-service password reset is an important feature, ideally moving towards passwordless solutions.  

**Definitions**  
- **Entra ID Licenses**: Licensing tiers for Microsoft Entra identity services that determine available features.  
- **P1 License**: Mid-tier license offering features like conditional access and self-service password reset with hybrid write-back.  
- **P2 License**: Premium license including advanced identity protection, privileged identity management, and access reviews.  
- **Governance Add-on**: An additional license component providing lifecycle workflows, entitlement management, certifications, and governance dashboards.  
- **Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)**: Feature allowing users to reset their passwords themselves, with hybrid write-back capability in P1.  

**Key Facts**  
- Microsoft 365 E5 license includes Entra P2 license.  
- Microsoft 365 E3 license includes Entra P1 license.  
- Governance add-on is a newer addition that enhances lifecycle and governance capabilities.  
- Conditional Access is a P1 feature and critical for HR-driven provisioning.  
- Privileged Identity Management and Identity Protection are P2 features.  
- Self-service password reset with write-back requires P1 license.  

**Examples**  
- Privileged users assigned P2 licenses for privileged identity management and stronger identity protection.  
- Basic workers assigned P1 licenses for conditional access and self-service password reset.  
- Some users assigned governance add-on for lifecycle workflow capabilities.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- License assignment should be flexible and role-based, not one-size-fits-all.  
- P1 license is essential for conditional access and hybrid self-service password reset.  
- P2 license is necessary for advanced security and governance features.  
- Governance add-on extends lifecycle and audit capabilities beyond P2.  
- Moving towards passwordless authentication is ideal, but self-service password reset remains important.  
- Hybrid environments benefit from password write-back enabled by P1 license.
