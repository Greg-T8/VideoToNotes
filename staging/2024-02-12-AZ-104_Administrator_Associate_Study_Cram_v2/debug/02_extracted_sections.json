RBAC roles can be assigned at any of these scopes.  \n- Least privilege principle: assign the minimum permissions needed at the smallest possible scope to reduce risk.  \n- Roles are collections of actions that apply to resource providers and their resources.  \n- Role assignments link an identity, a role, and a scope.  \n- Built-in roles include Owner, Contributor, Reader, each with different permission levels.  \n- Custom roles can be created by cloning existing roles and adding/removing specific permissions to tailor access precisely.  \n- Role assignments are inherited down the resource hierarchy (e.g., a role assigned at a management group applies to all underlying subscriptions and resources).  \n- RBAC roles differ from Entra roles, which apply to tenant-level permissions.  \n- User Access Administrator role allows elevating permissions across subscriptions that trust the tenant.  \n- Resource locks can be applied at subscription, resource group, or resource level to prevent deletion or make resources read-only.\n\n**Definitions**  \n- **Role**: A set of permissions (actions) that can be assigned to an identity for managing Azure resources.  \n- **Scope**: The level at which a role assignment applies (management group, subscription, resource group, or resource).  \n- **Role Assignment**: The binding of an identity to a role at a specific scope.  \n- **Owner**: Built-in role with full permissions including managing access.  \n- **Contributor**: Built-in role with permissions to manage resources but cannot manage access.  \n- **Reader**: Built-in role with read-only access to resources.  \n- **Custom Role**: A user-defined role created by modifying existing roles to fit specific permission needs.  \n- **User Access Administrator**: A role that allows a user to grant access to Azure resources, often used by global admins to elevate permissions.  \n- **Resource Lock**: A mechanism to prevent accidental deletion or modification of resources, with two types: Delete lock and Read-only lock.\n\n**Key Facts**  \n- Owner role can have up to 16,000 permissions because it can perform any action on any resource.  \n- Role assignments can be inherited from higher scopes down to individual resources.  \n- Custom roles allow adding or excluding specific permissions, including wildcard permissions with exceptions.  \n- RBAC roles apply to Azure resources, while Entra roles apply to tenant-level permissions.  \n- User Access Administrator permission can be granted at the root scope to enable permission elevation across subscriptions.  \n- Locks can be applied at multiple levels and are either \"cannot delete\" or \"read-only.\"\n\n**Examples**  \n- Network team given a role at a high management group level to manage virtual networks across the entire structure.  \n- A subscription user might have a role only at the subscription or resource group level for limited access.  \n- Viewing access control on a resource group shows many possible roles because it contains many resource types.  \n- Viewing access control on a container registry or storage account shows fewer roles relevant to that resource type.  \n- A BLOB data owner role assigned directly on a storage resource.  \n- A managed identity assigned a role on a specific virtual machine resource.  \n- Creating a custom role by cloning an existing role and removing write or delete permissions to enforce least privilege.\n\n**Key Takeaways \ud83c\udfaf**  \n- Always apply the principle of least privilege: assign only the permissions necessary at the smallest scope possible.  \n- Use groups for role assignments rather than individual users to simplify management and avoid orphaned permissions.  \n- Understand role inheritance and how assignments at higher scopes affect all underlying resources.  \n- Be cautious with powerful built-in roles like Owner; avoid over-assigning these roles.  \n- Custom roles are valuable for tailoring permissions when built-in roles are too broad.  \n- RBAC roles are distinct from Entra roles; know which applies to your scenario.  \n- Use User Access Administrator role carefully to enable permission elevation when needed.  \n- Implement resource locks to protect critical resources from accidental deletion or modification."

Standard is recommended as Basic is being retired by September 2025.  \n- Azure supports bringing your own public IP prefixes (ranges) with specific size requirements and validation processes.  \n- For outbound internet access, explicit configuration is required (e.g., public IP, NAT gateway, Azure Firewall, or Standard Load Balancer with outbound rules) as implicit internet access is being deprecated.  \n\n**Definitions**  \n- **Virtual Network (VNet)**: A logically isolated network in Azure that provides IP address space and subnetting within a specific subscription and region.  \n- **Subnet**: A subdivision of a VNet\u2019s IP address range, used to organize and isolate resources within the VNet.  \n- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: A method for allocating IP addresses and IP routing.  \n- **Public IP Address**: An IP address reachable from the internet, which can be associated with Azure resources for inbound/outbound connectivity.  \n- **Standard SKU Public IP**: A static, highly available public IP address recommended for use in Azure.  \n- **Basic SKU Public IP**: A legacy SKU for public IPs that can be dynamic; being retired by September 2025.  \n- **NAT Gateway**: A resource that provides outbound internet connectivity for resources in a subnet, efficiently managing port allocation for SNAT.  \n- **Azure Firewall**: A managed network security service that can control outbound and inbound traffic with user-defined routes.  \n- **Virtual NIC**: A virtual network interface card attached to a resource, which receives an IP address from the subnet\u2019s address space.  \n\n**Key Facts**  \n- VNets cannot span multiple subscriptions or regions.  \n- Common private IP ranges used: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16 (RFC 1918).  \n- Each subnet loses 5 IP addresses: network address (.0), broadcast address (.255 for /24), gateway (.1), and two DNS addresses (.2 and .3).  \n- Public IP prefixes brought into Azure must be between /21 and /24 for IPv4, and /48 for IPv6.  \n- Basic SKU public IPs will be retired on September 3, 2025; Standard SKU is preferred.  \n- Subnets are regional and can span all Availability Zones in that region.  \n- DHCP is used internally by Azure to assign IPs; users cannot run their own DHCP servers in VNets.  \n- Static private IP assignment is possible by reserving an IP for a resource via Azure Fabric.  \n- Implicit outbound internet access from VNets is being deprecated; explicit configuration is required for internet connectivity.  \n\n**Examples**  \n- VNet named \"VNet1\" defined with one or more IPv4 CIDR ranges.  \n- Subnets labeled subnet1, subnet2, subnet3, subnet4 as subsets of the VNet IP space.  \n- Assigning a public IP directly to a resource\u2019s network configuration (not recommended for high availability).  \n- Using a Standard Load Balancer with backend pools for resilient internet-facing services.  \n- Associating a NAT gateway at the subnet level to provide outbound internet connectivity.  \n\n**Key Takeaways \ud83c\udfaf**  \n- Always design VNets within a single subscription and region boundary.  \n- Choose unique IP address spaces for VNets and subnets to avoid routing conflicts, especially when connecting to on-premises or other VNets.  \n- Remember the 5 reserved IP addresses per subnet when planning IP allocation.  \n- Use Standard SKU public IPs for internet-facing resources to ensure static and supported IPs.  \n- Plan for explicit outbound internet connectivity configurations as implicit access is being phased out.  \n- Consider using NAT gateways or Azure Firewall for efficient and secure outbound internet access rather than assigning public IPs directly to resources.  \n- Bringing your own public IP prefixes is possible but involves a complex validation and provisioning process.  \n- Subnets are regional and can span multiple Availability Zones, providing flexibility in resource placement."
