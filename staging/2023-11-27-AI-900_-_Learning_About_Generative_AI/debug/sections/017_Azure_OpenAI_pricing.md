### 🎤 [00:45:02 – 00:45:44] Azure OpenAI pricing  
**Timestamp**: 00:45:02 – 00:45:44

**Key Concepts**  
- Pricing is usage-based for Azure OpenAI services.  
- Costs depend on the number of tokens processed (both prompts and completions).  
- Different models have different pricing tiers.  
- Creating the Azure OpenAI service instance itself does not incur a cost.  
- Available models include GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, fine-tuned models, image models, and embedding models.  
- Context size varies by model.

**Definitions**  
- **Tokens**: Units of text processed by the model, used to calculate usage and pricing.  
- **Prompt tokens**: Tokens in the input sent to the model.  
- **Completion tokens**: Tokens generated by the model as output (inference).  

**Key Facts**  
- Pricing is charged per thousand tokens processed.  
- Different Azure regions offer different available services/models.  
- Pricing varies based on the model used and the amount of tokens processed.  

**Examples**  
- Mention of GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 models with varying context sizes.  
- Reference to fine-tuning, image, and embedding models as part of the pricing structure.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- You only pay for what you use in terms of tokens; no upfront cost for creating the service.  
- Check the Azure region carefully as available models and services differ by region.  
- Understand the distinction between prompt tokens and completion tokens for accurate cost estimation.  
- Multiple model types are available, each potentially with different pricing.
