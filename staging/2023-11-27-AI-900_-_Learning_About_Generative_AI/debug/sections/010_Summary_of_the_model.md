### 🎤 [00:26:41 – 00:27:38] Summary of the model  
**Timestamp**: 00:26:41 – 00:27:38

**Key Concepts**  
- Transformer models power large language models (LLMs).  
- Self-attention mechanism enables the model to maintain context by understanding relationships between tokens.  
- Large language models are computationally expensive to train and run inference on.  
- There is ongoing work to create smaller, task-focused language models that are cheaper and faster to train and tune.

**Definitions**  
- **Transformer model**: A neural network architecture that uses self-attention to process input data, enabling it to keep track of context over long sequences.  
- **Self-attention**: A mechanism allowing the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input relative to each other, maintaining context and relationships.  
- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: A model based on transformer architecture trained on vast amounts of data to generate or understand language.

**Key Facts**  
- The fundamental architecture behind LLMs is the transformer model with self-attention.  
- Training and inference of large models require significant GPU resources and time.  
- Smaller language models are being developed to reduce cost and increase tuning speed.

**Examples**  
- Remembering the phrase: "don't give John Green things to eat" as an example of maintaining context through self-attention.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- The core of all large language models is the transformer architecture using self-attention.  
- Maintaining context is crucial and enabled by self-attention.  
- Large models are powerful but resource-intensive.  
- Smaller, specialized models offer a practical alternative for efficiency and faster tuning.
