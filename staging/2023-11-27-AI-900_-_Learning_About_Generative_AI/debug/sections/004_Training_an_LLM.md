### 🎤 [00:05:16 – 00:09:06] Training an LLM  
**Timestamp**: 00:05:16 – 00:09:06

**Key Concepts**  
- Training a large language model (LLM) requires huge amounts of data and computational resources.  
- The training process involves adjusting parameters (weights and biases) in a neural network to predict the next token in a sequence.  
- The model learns from diverse sources such as web crawls, Wikipedia, books, and other large text corpora.  
- GPUs are heavily used for training due to their parallel processing capabilities.  
- The number of parameters in modern LLMs ranges from billions to trillions, directly impacting model capability.  
- Once training is complete, the model becomes essentially read-only and does not change during inference.  
- Increasing model size (parameters) generally improves performance and intelligence, with no known upper limit currently.  

**Definitions**  
- **Inference**: The process where a trained model predicts the next token(s) based on a given prompt until it completes the sequence.  
- **Parameters**: Numerical values (weights and biases) within the neural network that determine how input data is transformed to output predictions.  

**Key Facts**  
- Training data sources include web crawls, Wikipedia, books, and other libraries.  
- Training requires massive computational power, typically involving GPUs.  
- Modern LLMs have billions to trillions of parameters.  
- After training, the model is fixed and does not update during inference.  
- Larger models tend to perform better, analogous to how a bigger brain can learn more.  

**Examples**  
- None explicitly mentioned in this section, but the analogy of a baby’s brain growing larger and smarter was used to illustrate model scaling.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Training an LLM is a resource-intensive process involving large datasets and extensive computation.  
- The model’s intelligence and capability scale with the number of parameters and amount of training data.  
- After training, the LLM is static and used for inference only.  
- GPUs are critical hardware for both training and running these models efficiently.  
- Understanding parameters is key to grasping how LLMs function internally.
