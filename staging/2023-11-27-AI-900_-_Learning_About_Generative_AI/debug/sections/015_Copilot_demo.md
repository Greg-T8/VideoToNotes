### 🎤 [00:39:56 – 00:42:23] Copilot demo  
**Timestamp**: 00:39:56 – 00:42:23

**Key Concepts**  
- Copilots act as generative AI SaaS solutions that assist users by accelerating tasks and providing guidance when stuck.  
- Copilots ground their responses using internet search results (e.g., Bing index) to provide accurate and referenced answers.  
- Integration of multimodal capabilities such as image input and generation (via DALL-E 3) enhances interaction.  
- Copilots can generate and modify images based on user prompts.  
- Code generation is integrated within the same AI model, supporting multiple programming languages (example: PowerShell script).  
- Azure OpenAI service hosts large language models in the Azure cloud, enabling custom application development.

**Definitions**  
- **Copilot**: A generative AI service that assists users by performing tasks, answering questions, generating content, and providing suggestions without requiring manual intervention.  
- **DALL-E 3**: An image generation AI integrated with the copilot that can create and modify images based on textual prompts.  
- **Azure OpenAI**: Microsoft’s cloud-hosted service offering access to large language models for building custom AI-powered applications.

**Key Facts**  
- Copilots ground answers by searching the Bing internet index and reference the source articles.  
- The AI is multimodal, capable of processing and generating both text and images.  
- Example prompt for image generation: "Create a picture of a bald English man sitting on a cloud with a laptop."  
- Code generation example: Creating a PowerShell script to calculate pi to 10 digits.  
- Separate code generation models have been consolidated into the main AI model.  

**Examples**  
- Asking Bing copilot: "What are three services of Azure OpenAI?" — it searches the web and provides referenced answers.  
- Image generation via DALL-E 3: generating and modifying images based on user descriptions.  
- Writing code: generating a PowerShell script for pi calculation.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Copilots provide a seamless, fully managed AI experience that requires no manual setup from users.  
- Grounding AI responses in real-time internet data improves accuracy and transparency.  
- Multimodal AI capabilities expand the range of tasks from text to image generation and modification.  
- Integration of code generation within the same AI model simplifies development workflows.  
- Azure OpenAI service enables enterprises to build custom AI applications leveraging these large language models in the cloud.
