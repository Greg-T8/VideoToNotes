**Key Concepts**  
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) mimics human capabilities such as vision, speech, natural language, document intelligence, and knowledge.  
- Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where models are trained on labeled data to perform tasks without explicit programming.  
- Types of ML include supervised learning (regression, classification - binary and multiclass) and unsupervised learning (finding groupings without labels).  
- Deep Learning uses neural networks with layers of neurons, activation functions, weights, and biases to power advanced AI capabilities.  
- Azure AI services include single-purpose services (vision, text, translation) and multi-service endpoints (no free SKU).  
- Authentication for Azure AI endpoints can be done via keys or Entra ID integrated authentication, accessible via REST or SDKs.  
- Responsible AI emphasizes fairness, bias mitigation, reliability, safety, privacy, security, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability.  
- Azure AI Vision services offer image analysis (captions, tags, object detection, background removal, thumbnails, text extraction) and face detection (face recognition, direction, liveness detection).  
- Natural Language services analyze text for language, sentiment, key phrases, entities, summarization, and knowledge base creation.  
- Language Understanding extracts intent and entities from utterances.  
- Speech services provide text-to-speech synthesis, speech-to-text recognition, and translation (including custom domain adaptation).  
- Document Intelligence handles large-scale document analysis with prebuilt and custom form models.  
- Knowledge Mining (Azure AI Search) supports multiple data sources, enriches data via skills, and creates text and vector indexes for querying.  

**Definitions**  
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Technology that mimics human cognitive functions such as vision, speech, and natural language understanding.  
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI where algorithms learn patterns from labeled data to make predictions or decisions.  
- **Deep Learning**: A type of ML using neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns.  
- **Activation Function**: A function in a neural network neuron that determines whether the neuron should activate and pass information forward.  
- **Azure AI Services**: Cloud-based AI capabilities offered by Microsoft, including vision, language, speech, and search services.  
- **Responsible AI**: Principles and practices ensuring AI systems are fair, unbiased, reliable, secure, inclusive, transparent, and accountable.  
- **Knowledge Mining**: The process of extracting useful information from large datasets using AI-powered search and enrichment techniques.  

**Key Facts**  
- Training custom document models can be done with as few as five examples.  
- Azure AI multi-service endpoints do not have a free SKU; single-service endpoints may have free options.  
- Authentication methods include API keys and Entra ID integrated authentication.  
- Azure AI Search was formerly known as Azure Cognitive Search.  
- Responsible AI covers fairness, bias, reliability, safety, privacy, security, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability.  

**Examples**  
- Querying a vector-based hybrid search to find documents about dogs going to parks using natural language variations.  
- Vision service capabilities: generating captions, deep captions, tags, object detection, background removal, smart cropping thumbnails, and text extraction from images.  
- Face detection can identify face direction, ears, verify identity, and detect liveness to prevent spoofing.  
- Natural language processing can detect sentiment, key phrases, entities, summarize text, and build Q&A knowledge bases for bots.  
- Speech services can synthesize speech from text, transcribe speech to text, and translate spoken or written language, including custom domain adaptation.  
- Document Intelligence can analyze receipts and invoices and be trained on custom forms with minimal examples.  
- Knowledge Mining chunks data into smaller pieces, enriches it, and creates text and vector indexes for efficient querying.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the broad scope of AI and its subsets: ML and deep learning.  
- Familiarize yourself with Azure AI service types, their capabilities, and authentication methods.  
- Responsible AI is critical—ensure fairness, privacy, transparency, and accountability in AI solutions.  
- Explore and experiment with free SKUs of Azure AI services to gain practical experience.  
- Use Microsoft Learn and sandbox environments to prepare for exams and understand the practical application of AI services.  
- Manage exam time wisely: do not spend too long on any one question, eliminate obviously wrong answers, and revisit difficult questions later.
