### 🎤 [00:09:33 – 00:13:40] Training data types  
**Timestamp**: 00:09:33 – 00:13:40

**Key Concepts**  
- Different types of training data exist beyond just "training data" itself.  
- Supervised learning involves labeled data.  
- Supervised learning can be subdivided into regression and classification.  
- Classification can be binary (two classes) or multiclass (multiple classes).  
- Unsupervised learning involves unlabeled data and focuses on clustering or grouping based on similarities.  
- Azure Machine Learning Studio supports creating custom models, importing and labeling datasets, training, testing, and deploying models.

**Definitions**  
- **Supervised learning**: Training with data that has known labels.  
- **Regression**: A type of supervised learning where the output is numeric (e.g., predicting house prices).  
- **Classification**: A type of supervised learning where the output is a category or class.  
- **Binary classification**: Classification with two mutually exclusive classes (e.g., will a viewer like a video or not).  
- **Multiclass classification**: Classification with multiple possible classes (e.g., video genres like horror, fiction, learning).  
- **Unsupervised learning**: Training with data that has no labels, focusing on finding clusters or groups within the data.

**Key Facts**  
- Supervised learning requires labeled data.  
- Regression is used for numeric prediction tasks.  
- Classification tasks can be binary or multiclass.  
- Unsupervised learning looks for natural groupings in unlabeled data.  
- Azure Machine Learning Studio (ml.azure.com) allows importing data, labeling, training, testing, and deploying models.  
- Models can be deployed in containers on-premises or in Azure cloud services like Kubernetes or container instances.

**Examples**  
- Regression example: Predicting house prices.  
- Binary classification example: Predicting if a viewer will like a video or not.  
- Multiclass classification example: Categorizing videos into genres such as horror, fiction, or learning.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understanding the type of training data (supervised vs unsupervised) is crucial for selecting the right machine learning approach.  
- Supervised learning requires labeled data and can be tailored to numeric or categorical outputs.  
- Unsupervised learning is useful when labels are not available and the goal is to find inherent patterns.  
- Azure Machine Learning Studio is a comprehensive tool for managing the entire lifecycle of custom model training and deployment.  
- Deployment flexibility allows running models in various environments, not limited to the cloud.
