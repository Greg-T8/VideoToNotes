**Key Concepts**  
- Computer vision deals with processing and understanding images.  
- Images are fundamentally composed of pixels, each having a value.  
- Multimodal models support multiple input types/modalities such as images, language, video, and audio.  
- Foundational models are broad in capability and can be fine-tuned for specific use cases.  
- Vision services include tasks like image analysis and captioning.

**Definitions**  
- **Image**: A collection of pixels, where each pixel has a value (e.g., grayscale values from 0 to 255 or multiple values for color).  
- **Multimodal**: Refers to models that can understand and interact with multiple types of data/modalities (e.g., images, text, video, audio).  
- **Foundational model**: A broad, general-purpose AI model that can be adapted or fine-tuned for specific tasks or domains.

**Key Facts**  
- Grayscale pixel values typically range from 0 to 255.  
- Color images have multiple values per pixel (e.g., RGB channels).  
- JPEG images use compression to store images more efficiently than raw pixel data.  
- Examples of multimodal models include GPT-4O and Microsoft’s Florence model.  
- Foundational models serve as a base for building more specialized solutions.

**Examples**  
- An image of a number “7” represented by pixels with values (e.g., 255 for white pixels forming the shape, zeros elsewhere).  
- Vision services can analyze an image (e.g., a cow under a tree) and generate captions describing the content.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understanding the pixel-based nature of images is fundamental to computer vision.  
- Multimodal AI models enhance interaction by supporting various data types beyond just images.  
- Foundational models provide a versatile starting point for developing tailored computer vision applications.  
- Vision services like image analysis and captioning are practical applications of computer vision technology.
