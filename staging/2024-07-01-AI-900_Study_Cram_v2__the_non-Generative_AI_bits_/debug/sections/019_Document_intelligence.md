### 🎤 [01:02:31 – 01:06:05] Document intelligence  
**Timestamp**: 01:02:31 – 01:06:05

**Key Concepts**  
- Document intelligence involves analyzing various types of documents (text bodies, forms, receipts, invoices) to extract structured data.  
- It evolved from the former "Forms Recognizer" service to emphasize AI capabilities.  
- Uses pre-built AI models to understand semantic meaning in documents, not just OCR text extraction.  
- Supports extraction of key-value pairs and outputs results in JSON format.  
- Works with PDFs and images as input formats.  
- Allows creation of custom models with as few as 5 sample forms using a no-code interface (Document Intelligence Studio).  
- Custom models can be trained to recognize specific form structures and output customized data.  

**Definitions**  
- **Document Intelligence**: An AI-powered service that analyzes documents to extract structured, meaningful data beyond simple text recognition.  
- **Pre-built Models**: Ready-to-use AI models designed to handle common document types like receipts, invoices, identity cards, health insurance cards, and tax forms.  
- **Custom Models**: User-trained AI models created by providing sample documents to tailor extraction to specific form layouts or data needs.  

**Key Facts**  
- Only 5 example forms are needed to create a custom model.  
- Outputs extracted data as JSON.  
- Supports multiple document types including PDFs and images.  
- Document Intelligence Studio provides a no-code environment for model creation.  
- Pre-built models cover a wide range of document types (invoices, receipts, identity cards, health insurance cards, tax forms).  

**Examples**  
- Recognizing and extracting addresses and phone numbers from documents.  
- Using pre-built models to analyze receipts and invoices.  
- Creating a custom model by uploading 5 sample forms to extract specific form fields.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Document Intelligence is more than OCR; it understands the semantic meaning of document content.  
- Pre-built models enable quick deployment for common document types without training.  
- Custom models allow flexibility for unique or proprietary form layouts with minimal training data.  
- The no-code Document Intelligence Studio simplifies model creation and deployment.  
- Supports diverse input formats (PDFs, images) making it versatile for many document processing scenarios.
