**Timestamp**: 00:22:32 – 00:23:07

**Key Concepts**  
- Different types of machine learning approaches  
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) as rule-based or explicitly programmed behavior  
- Machine Learning (ML) using labeled data for prediction, labeling, and classification  
- Deep Learning leveraging neural networks for advanced tasks  

**Definitions**  
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Systems where behavior is explicitly programmed or rules are written to perform tasks (e.g., early chess computers).  
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Algorithms trained on labeled data to predict or classify new data.  
- **Deep Learning**: Use of neural networks to model complex patterns and perform sophisticated tasks.  

**Key Facts**  
- Early chess computers operated similarly to AI with explicit rules rather than learning.  
- Machine learning requires labeled data to train models for prediction and classification.  
- Deep learning uses neural networks and is often applied in advanced AI solutions.  

**Examples**  
- Early chess computers as an example of AI with explicit programming.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- AI, ML, and deep learning represent a spectrum from rule-based systems to data-driven neural networks.  
- Understanding these distinctions helps in selecting appropriate approaches for different problems.  
- Deep learning enables leveraging powerful neural networks for complex tasks beyond traditional ML.
