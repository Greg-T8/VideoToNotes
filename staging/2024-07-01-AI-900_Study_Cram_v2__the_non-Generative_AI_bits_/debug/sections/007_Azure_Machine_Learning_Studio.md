### 🎤 [00:13:40 – 00:14:37] Azure Machine Learning Studio  
**Timestamp**: 00:13:40 – 00:14:37

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure Machine Learning Studio is a cloud service designed to help users perform custom machine learning training.  
- Models trained in Azure ML Studio can be deployed in various environments, including containers.  
- Deployment options include on-premises containers, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure Container Instances (ACI).  
- Azure ML Studio supports both custom model training and access to pre-built models.

**Definitions**  
- **Azure Machine Learning Studio**: An Azure cloud service that facilitates custom training, testing, and deployment of machine learning models.  
- **Container**: A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, such as a trained ML model, in different environments.

**Key Facts**  
- Models trained in Azure ML Studio are not limited to cloud hosting; they can be deployed in containers on-premises or in Azure services like AKS and ACI.  
- Azure ML Studio provides flexibility in how and where models are run after training.  
- While many pre-built models exist, Azure ML Studio is specifically useful when custom training is required.

**Examples**  
- Deploying a trained model to a container that runs on-premises or in Azure Kubernetes Service.  
- Using Azure Container Instances to host a custom-trained model.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Azure Machine Learning Studio is a versatile platform for custom ML model training and deployment.  
- Deployment flexibility allows models to run in cloud or on-premises environments using containers.  
- Pre-built models are available, but Azure ML Studio is essential when custom training is needed.  
- Understanding deployment options (containers, AKS, ACI) is important for operationalizing ML models effectively.
