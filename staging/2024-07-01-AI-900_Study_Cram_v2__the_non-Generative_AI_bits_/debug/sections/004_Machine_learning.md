### 🎤 [00:04:38 – 00:05:22] Machine learning  
**Timestamp**: 00:04:38 – 00:05:22

**Key Concepts**  
- Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence.  
- Instead of manually writing all the logic for tasks (e.g., number recognition), the computer can train itself using past data.  
- The training process involves using historical data to build a model that can make future predictions.

**Definitions**  
- **Machine learning**: A branch of AI focused on enabling computers to learn from past data and improve their performance on tasks without explicit programming of every rule.

**Key Facts**  
- Machine learning relies on having training data.  
- Training data consists of many examples with associated correct answers (labels).  
- Features are the individual pieces of data or attributes used to train the model.

**Examples**  
- Number recognition: Instead of coding every possible variation of the number "1," the computer learns from many examples of handwritten or printed "1"s.  
- Other example contexts mentioned include pictures of numbers, pictures of oranges, or historical temperature data from engines.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Writing explicit logic for complex recognition tasks is impractical due to the vast variability.  
- Machine learning automates this by learning patterns from data.  
- The quality and quantity of training data are crucial for building effective machine learning models.  
- Understanding features and labeled data is fundamental to the training process.
