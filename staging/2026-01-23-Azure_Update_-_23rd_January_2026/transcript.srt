00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:00,960
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,800
Welcome to this week's Azure update.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,200
It's the 23rd of January.

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,960
As always, we have the chapters, so you can jump to any new update you care about the most.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,720
New videos this week, so I did a deep dive into the new Foundry IQ.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:27,200
So if you think about the existing Azure AI search we're used to, how does this build on top of that to give our AI apps and agents the ability to really interact with knowledge,

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,000
and help accelerate everything we're doing.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,080
Then how does this relate a little bit to the Fabric IQ and the Work IQ?

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,280
Only one video this week because then I was in New York.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,320
I did the security part of the keynote, which was a lot of fun.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,400
And hopefully you get to go and see an AI tour in your location.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,960
So on to what's new on the compute side.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:57,280
So AKS now has these deployment safeguards in GA, and specifically, there are new pod security standards.

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:09,360
So again, this is part of this all-up deployment safeguard, but it lets me centrally manage a number of different profiles for baseline, restricted, and privileged standards that you have.

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:19,160
Now, these cover all of the namespaces, privileged containers, capabilities exposed, types of mount, volume, use of routes.

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:26,080
So a whole bunch of different configurations and capabilities you can control via these standards.

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,120
And I can enable it on new, on existing clusters.

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,560
And if there's certain special namespaces that you need to exclude, you can do that as well.

19
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,800
On the network side,

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,320
So the standard V2 NAT gateway has gone GA.

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,080
So this is a huge deal.

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:54,400
So the V2 version of NAT gateway and its associated public IP, remember, NAT gateway is all about, hey, I've got resources that live within a virtual network.

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,680
It's a managed way to give them outbound access to the internet.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,760
Because remember, the default just internet egress,

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,040
goes away.

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,200
You need to have a specific version that you're implementing.

27
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:20,160
Before, it was kind of regional or zonal, but many of our architectures will use zone redundant configurations, which NAT gateway did not support.

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,600
The V2 does.

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,960
I can deploy a zone-redundant version, so it makes a huge difference to my architecture.

30
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:39,320
I don't have to now try and deal with zonal instances and line up my architecture to particular subnets where a NAT gateway is associated to, which didn't really logically flow because subnets are cross-zone.

31
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,360
I can have 100 gigabits per second of throughput, 10 million packets per second.

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,880
I have dual stack support.

33
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,320
So I can attach, I think it's up to 16 IPv4, IPv6 addresses through which the outbound traffic will flow.

34
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,600
And that would be their source address for the receiving systems if I maybe wanted to restrict it based on IP.

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,840
I can enable flow logs so I can get great traffic insights.

36
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,320
So this is a really big deal.

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,320
On the storage side, so

38
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,440
User-delegated shared access signatures, SaaS, is now available for tables, files, and queues.

39
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,720
Now, we had this for BLOB already, and basically, based on this, you can see it's bringing it to the other services that make up a storage account.

40
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:39,040
And the whole goal of the user delegation SAS is it's more secure than the other account or service SAS because both the user, sorry, the account and service SAS, remember that's signed by the storage account keys, which are these all powerful.

41
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,480
With the user delegated SAS, it's being signed by the delegated identity, i.e.

42
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,920
the entra ID account that is creating it.

43
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,120
So that means it can never have more permissions.

44
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,520
than the identity creating that delegation.

45
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,760
It can be less, and it can only be valid for up to seven days.

46
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,720
So it's a more secure version of that.

47
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,480
Azure File Sync is now available in Israel Central.

48
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:13,040
Remember, Azure File Sync is providing the service that my Windows File Servers have SMB shares.

49
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,200
Well, they can synchronize to each other via the cloud shares.

50
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,840
So an Azure File Share, I have the content stored in that Azure File Share.

51
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,000
If I'm running out a capacity on my SMB share, it can tear content off.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,800
So it will still look like it's there, but it's actually not storing it locally anymore.

53
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,080
If someone tries to access it, then it's going to pull it down.

54
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,160
There'll be an increased latency as it pulls it back down, but it essentially gives me this near infinite looking set of shares.

55
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:52,000
By having the sync service in different locations, we will reduce the lag of those services, and also maybe I need to meet certain data residency requirements.

56
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,920
And then for Azure NetApp Files, the app volume group for Oracle now has data protection volume support.

57
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,160
Now remember, the whole goal of the app volume groups for Oracle is, well, a database typically is not just one volume.

58
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:14,800
You're going to have a whole series of different volumes from kind of 2 to 12, depending on the size, the configurations of the database.

59
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,240
So with the app volume groups, it creates all of those volumes following best practices.

60
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,320
now I can configure both cross-zone and cross-region replication when I'm using this.

61
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,120
And it's only going to send the change blocks as part of that replication.

62
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,600
Today I have to enable it by the REST API.

63
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:45,120
But the whole goal of this is now customers can safeguard your data against potential threats and disruptions, just helping you ensure your continuous availability.

64
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
On the miscellaneous side,

65
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,640
So Azure load testing is in a new region, so Switzerland North.

66
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,600
This is the managed service that lets me perform potentially very high scale load testing, because it's using the cloud as that engine.

67
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,880
I can use Apache JMeter, local scripts, or I can even use a web experience, which will then go and generate the script for me.

68
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,120
It gives me a lot of analytics.

69
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:20,600
So not only stress testing it, it's going to give me the analytics of how the components behaved under that stress so I can easily go and identify, for example, potential bottlenecks, know where I need to go and focus.

70
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,680
And there's kind of an extension to that.

71
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,920
App testing has a reporting update in GA.

72
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:36,240
So Azure App Testing includes features around the load testing, but also more specific testing of my end-to-end flows.

73
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:44,720
So, it now includes Playwright Workspaces reporting that, again, I use for that cloud-scale web testing.

74
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,920
It has this enhanced reporting, so for my debugging cases, it's going to be easier and faster.

75
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,840
So, what I can do is, when I turn the debugging on, you specify a storage account.

76
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,320
And then once I have that data in the storage account, yes, I can go and interact with it.

77
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,720
But through the portal, I can actually go and use a trace viewer for deeper analysis and just go and view the all out reporting of what is going on.

78
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,760
And then GitHub Copilot now has an SDK.

79
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,360
So the same agentic GitHub Copilot CLI we're used to, we might use it integrated with VS Code.

80
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,200
Well, now I can use it within my own apps, my own experiences.

81
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,400
I still get

82
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,640
all the advanced capabilities, not just sort of ask response.

83
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,520
I can still do multi-step planning, I can use multiple models, I can leverage MCP servers, I can build custom agents, all of the great capabilities.

84
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,720
I can just now trigger it through an SDK so I can use it in whatever way I want.

85
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,280
And that was it.

86
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
So I hope that was useful.

87
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,160
Until next video, take care.
