00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,280
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,760
In this video, I want to dive into learning Azure.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,520
This is the third version I've created this video because Azure is vast.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,760
There are many different ways to learn Azure.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,960
There's many different aspects of Azure.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,560
There is no right way.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,000
Everyone learns differently.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,840
But my goal is to go over what are some of the key steps and stages I would think about as you want to learn Azure.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,240
Now, firstly, I think there are those foundational things that everyone should understand.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,040
I would think about things like identity.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:51,200
Now, that includes things like Entra ID, formerly known as Azure AD, understanding authentication, authorization, and how things like conditional access, risk, entitlement management come into that.

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,000
And identity is not just for users anymore.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,520
We think about agents.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,560
So those AI applications and capabilities with Agent 365, they get identities as well.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,600
And then really expands into the idea of security.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,600
And of course, identity is a big part of security in the cloud.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,760
The network is no longer that moat around our services.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,040
The first entry point is often identity.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,120
But it is defense in depth.

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,320
We have many layers of security that we think about.

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,640
We don't rely on one thing.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,480
We always think sort of 0 trust.

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,440
We constantly verify everything we're trying to do.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,720
So understanding of security and its implications.

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,720
Governance.

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,640
So again, in the cloud, the process has changed.

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,240
Maybe we used to provision a resource in the old days or on-prem by putting in a ticket.

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,280
And then

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,720
An IT operations person would look at the ticket, check the request, and if it meets regulations and requirements, would go and create it for you.

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,320
In the cloud, you just directly provision.

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,640
And so when we think about the governance, we use policies in the cloud.

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,800
So that the control plane of Azure, the Azure Resource Manager or ARM, it enforces your requirements.

33
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Then we also think about sort of cost management, some of those other aspects to it.

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,360
So governance is important.

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,800
understanding the basics of infrastructure.

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,360
Now that goes to compute services, it goes to network, it goes to data.

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:35,360
There's a whole set of different aspects to that, but understand the core building blocks we think about and also AI.

38
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,480
And AI is a super interesting one.

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,720
because it's both AI as services you can use.

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,640
So I might think about, sure, more traditional machine learning and classifications and content understanding.

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:56,080
But now the generative capabilities with the various, for example, open AI models, but many others as well.

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,320
But also as learning, AI can help us learn.

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,400
It can provide us guidance.

44
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,080
It can help us troubleshoot.

45
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,120
It can help explain things to us.

46
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,480
So

47
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:16,320
AI, I think, is a really useful one, both for performing solutions, but also for helping to understand.

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:28,640
Make sure you understand sort of core resiliency concepts about high availability, about disaster recovery, about recovery point, recovery time objectives, SLAs.

49
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,520
And you're always going to understand the idea of, well, what are these region things?

50
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:44,800
sets of services within a certain geography, and you're going to use multiple regions when we think about resiliency against some, maybe a natural disaster or some other problem.

51
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,440
But then I want to be able to distribute my workloads within a region.

52
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,520
You'll typically hear about availability zones.

53
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,600
So there's these three availability zones that your subscription sees.

54
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,680
And ideally what we want to do is when we have resources within a region,

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,840
We want to distribute them over those.

56
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,560
Think of different physical sets of data centers.

57
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:18,640
So now we're not going to be impacted by a single server or rack or cluster or even data center level event, compute, network, calling, control plane.

58
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,840
And so we want to be able to use those things.

59
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:28,240
And what are the types of replications, both synchronous, typically within a location, and asynchronous, going between locations?

60
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:46,000
And then, obviously, from these, you can branch off into other aspects: administration, app development, database design, database operations, again, more around the AI, DevOps, and ideally, you want to at least have a basic idea of those types of things.

61
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,440
Now, previously, I had a whole list of links.

62
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,920
to my content.

63
00:04:52,920 --> 00:05:02,640
Obviously on my YouTube channel, where you're watching this, I have lots of different videos, but people would kind of say, well, is there some curated order that maybe I could go and look at this stuff?

64
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,080
So I did go ahead and create this site.

65
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,160
So this is just learn.onboardtoazure.com.

66
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,800
It's just links to my videos.

67
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,000
I do need to update this and update it after I record this.

68
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,200
but it just walks through a potential learning path.

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:40,320
And some of it's my content, some of it's links to Microsoft learning courses, some of it's links to the exam and maybe the exam simulator environments, then admin, networking, all the different topics you might think about.

70
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,080
It's not all of my videos at all, but it's kind of a curated list.

71
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,200
that may help you as part of what you're doing.

72
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,880
So that's why I created this site.

73
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,320
It just links to the videos and maybe if you're looking for it, would give you a little bit of a path.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,280
Now the first thing you're going to need though to learn Azure is access to Azure.

75
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,040
You have to be hands-on.

76
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,560
Yes, you could maybe learn some basics through reading or watching my videos or someone else's videos,

77
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,400
But I really think you want to actually be using the technologies, because you'll see how it works, you'll see what doesn't work.

78
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,320
When it doesn't work, you'll work out how to make it work, and you'll learn it so much better.

79
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,880
So really emphasize getting some hands-on with it.

80
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,080
And there's different ways we can get access to Azure.

81
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,280
So obviously your company may just give you access.

82
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,160
as your organization.

83
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,280
They may give you access to a subscription.

84
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,600
And a subscription is like a logical billing boundary and security boundary for resources.

85
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,120
And that might be they've got part of an enterprise agreement.

86
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,400
It might be pay as you go.

87
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:02,880
But if it's you as an individual and you just want to kind of play around, you can absolutely create a free account.

88
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,000
And this free account gives you a number of different things.

89
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,120
So firstly,

90
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,800
you get $200 of credit that you can use for the first month.

91
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,000
But then what happens is there's a certain number of services that are free for 12 months.

92
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,360
We're going to dive into this.

93
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,280
And then there are some services that are just always free.

94
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,120
So you get a certain amount of the resource for a prolonged period.

95
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,520
So you can always do a certain amount at no cost whatsoever.

96
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,240
So, if we go and it's free for the first 12 months, so 12 months are free.

97
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:51,440
Well, I can see I get some AI custom vision, some compute, so I get a VM Linux, a VM Windows.

98
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,080
You get a certain number of hours of that capability of a specific SKU.

99
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:17,840
some containers, I get some database for free, both Cosmos DB, which is really that NoSQL document-based, can be multi-write, eventual consistency, and you can configure that through MySQL, through PostgreSQL, through SQL MI and service bus and networking.

100
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,400
So you get all these various things for 12 months.

101
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,920
And then there are also services that are just always free.

102
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,480
So you get a certain amount of, again, AI services here.

103
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,240
But also what's nice around here, for example, are things like, well, I get some data factory, I get some app service.

104
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,440
So 10 web or API apps.

105
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,120
I get a certain amount of batch functions, 1,000,000 requests.

106
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,240
And realize functions are serverless.

107
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,400
So I can actually do a lot with that.

108
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,160
Certain amounts of container storage and container apps.

109
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,880
So there's a lot of free things here.

110
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,400
Now if you look at the hours and the amounts of it, you're not going to be running a production environment off of this.

111
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,520
But one of the things we'll actually talk about a lot is the idea that, hey, we will go and...

112
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,440
start the service, we use it, and then we're going to shut it down.

113
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,800
So we can really maximize our use of the services we have available.

114
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:22,160
So I can get a trial account, I get 200 bucks in the first month, there's services for 12 months, and there's services that are always free.

115
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,200
And those always free ones, they kind of apply to all of the different subscriptions, even if it's kind of like a work subscription.

116
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:37,200
And the next thing we can then talk about though is let's say I've got MSDN or Visual Studio, where you get a certain amount of credit,

117
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,360
per month to use on Azure.

118
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,840
So Visual Studio Enterprise, I get $150 a month.

119
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
MSDN regular platform is 100.

120
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,920
Visual Studio Pro or Visual Studio Test Pro, I get $50.

121
00:09:47,920 --> 00:10:03,280
And that may not seem like a massive amount, but again, if we're efficient with how we actually create resources, stop them, delete them, then I can actually get a lot out of that.

122
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,400
Which really brings me to the idea of being efficient, especially if we have limited credit.

123
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:19,760
But even if you don't have a limited amount and you're part of an organization, you want to be a good custodian of your organization's money and size resources efficiently.

124
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,600
Auto scale them.

125
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,960
So change the number of instances you have as the load changes over some seasonality.

126
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,040
Maybe you get a busy time of the day, busy time of the week, busy time of the month, busy time of the year.

127
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,800
So always adjust the amount of resource you have based on the amount of work it has to do.

128
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:50,400
If you're working in a lab, for example, you're creating a lab, you're doing some kind of test, one of the constructs we have is you're going to have this idea that you'll create an Azure subscription.

129
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,400
So everything lives within a certain sub.

130
00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:01,360
And when we create resources, we group them together into something called a resource group.

131
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,720
Let's call this resource group one or give it a meaningful name, resource group test ABC or whatever that is.

132
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:18,560
If you're doing a certain test, a certain lab, put all of the resources that make up that lab or that test in the same resource group specific to that test.

133
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,720
So I create a virtual machine.

134
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,760
Well, that VM uses a managed disk.

135
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,040
That VM also maybe has an IP address.

136
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,560
These all cost you money.

137
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,080
Maybe it's also connecting to some kind of database that's being used as part of this.

138
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:44,760
Put them all together, because then what's going to happen is once we're finished with this lab, I can just go ahead and delete the entire resource group.

139
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:51,680
I don't risk just deleting the VM and forgetting to delete the disk or forgetting to delete some IP or forgetting to delete a database.

140
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,640
That's actually going to keep ticking along and costing me money.

141
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,280
Make sure you shut down compute services when you're not being used.

142
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:08,960
So a virtual machine, if I just stop it inside the guest operating system, it doesn't deprovision it from the Azure physical fabric.

143
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,600
So it's still taking up space on the server.

144
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,920
You're still going to pay for it.

145
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,200
You need to be looking for the words deallocated in the portal to show that, hey, it's not allocated to a machine anymore.

146
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,520
I'm not going to be paying anymore for the virtual machine's compute.

147
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,240
Now, you'll still be paying for its disk.

148
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:32,240
So that's why it's important, especially in dev environments, pick low performance options.

149
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,760
You probably don't need a really high performance disk in dev test unless you're actually trying to map to real world production performance.

150
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,840
If I'm just playing around, pick a standard hard disk drive, just see how it goes, make sure that's actually...

151
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
using the least amount of money possible.

152
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,360
So again, look at all the different options you have.

153
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,720
Often today there's scenarios, like a database, it'll give me a dev test option, it will pick lower SKUs.

154
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,240
So that can be really helpful.

155
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,080
Use Advisor for guidance.

156
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:09,440
So if I jump over for a second, so I actually go and look in the portal, you have this thing called Advisor.

157
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:20,080
And keep an eye on that because Advisor will actually give you guidance on things like, hey, we could pick a lower skew.

158
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,080
You could save some money.

159
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,080
It has this idea of recommendations.

160
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,440
But it will also give you hints about, hey, your security, your performance, your liability.

161
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:38,480
So it's just a really good place to go as you're learning to get some good hints of actually what I should be doing.

162
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,360
Which then really leads on to

163
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,120
How do I get good information about Azure?

164
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,200
And the portal's great.

165
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,760
So the first time you access the portals, you've gone and got a subscription or create one.

166
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,840
You'll go to portal.azure.com.

167
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,800
You're going to sign in with an Entra account.

168
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,560
That's kind of a corporate identity.

169
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,320
And you'll be in the home.

170
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,560
And one of the things you can do is just, you'll see some services in your favorites.

171
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,240
And you can adjust what is or isn't a favorite.

172
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,480
But if I just hover over it,

173
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,040
It actually starts to give me information.

174
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,440
So notice it's telling me recent resources, free trial.

175
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:23,580
training, useful links, for example, the documentation, all these other things, pricing information.

176
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:31,020
So it's giving me help about every single one of these, so I could go and learn more.

177
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:37,900
I can click all services, and I can do the same thing for everything.

178
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,020
And within here, I could then go and select, hey, do I want it to be a favorite?

179
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,500
Do I not want it to be a favorite?

180
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:52,420
I can enable or disable the idea of it showing in that menu bar on the left-hand side.

181
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:59,220
And again, I just hover over them to get these information cards for more information to help me learn it.

182
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,220
I mean, that's really the whole goal around doing this.

183
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,780
If one of the first things you're probably going to do is create a VM, or you'll create a virtual network first, and you'll go and create virtual machines.

184
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:15,660
But again, within here under virtual machines, I can see my VMs, but there's a getting started tab.

185
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,660
And if I hit that, it talks about all virtual machines.

186
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,380
Do I want to create more than one virtual machine?

187
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,420
Hey, let's look at viewing comparison charts of what my different options may be.

188
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,060
Help me find what is the best product for my workloads, like walk me through it.

189
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,420
It's also, let's go back up here.

190
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,780
Notice at the top, it's giving me this idea of

191
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,780
using AI, so this is the Azure Copilot.

192
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,260
Here's some suggestions in ways it can help me.

193
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,540
Check which VMs cannot access the internet, view virtual machines with critical alerts.

194
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,100
So it's given me help there as well.

195
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,100
Now, play around in the portal, look around the portal.

196
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,620
It is very intuitive.

197
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,220
It will guide you through things.

198
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,980
But also, Microsoft Learn is fantastic.

199
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,820
So learn.microsoft.com.

200
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,100
I can go and search it for any information I want.

201
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,380
You've got all the various documentation areas, it's got all the different products.

202
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,540
There's essential information, so I can browse all the product docs.

203
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,540
There's fantastic training.

204
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:36,060
So if I go and do this browse all training option, I can go and scan across all of the different Microsoft Learn training by the different areas that it has.

205
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,780
So here I can see I could search by product.

206
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,100
I could just go and search for a particular course.

207
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:48,940
I might search based on my role, the level of how advanced it is from over here on this left-hand side.

208
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,940
I could even say, look, just find me stuff related to particular courses.

209
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,300
And maybe only care about courses related to Azure.

210
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,860
So introduction to cloud infrastructure, let's have a look at that.

211
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,140
Okay, that would get me ready for AZ 900.

212
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,340
So that's really the Azure fundamentals exam.

213
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:21,900
So it's not just documentation, it has fantastic guides to actually get you up and running and learning and getting certified in the cloud.

214
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:29,180
Now you'll also at certain points start looking at CLIs like command line interfaces.

215
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:36,620
And yes, you could install things like the Azure PowerShell modules, the Microsoft Graph PowerShell modules, there's the Azure CLI.

216
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,820
but also I can access a cloud shell.

217
00:17:41,340 --> 00:18:04,420
So the cloud shell will just open you up a shell instance within the portal and I can actually switch between PowerShell and the Bash CLI, depending on if I'm more of a PowerShell person or maybe I'm more traditionally a Linux person and I like to use a CLI, but I can go and interact with it, see the various instances.

218
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,980
It's automatically going to authenticate

219
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,380
with whatever identity you're currently logged into the portal with.

220
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,740
You can upload and download files.

221
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,580
There's an editor, like a VS Code version of an editor I can integrate with.

222
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,420
It's really nice, powerful way to experiment with the CLI as well.

223
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,140
And then I mentioned the idea of AI helping you.

224
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,780
So you'll notice here in the portal, you have this copilot button.

225
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,580
So this is Azure's Copilot.

226
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:46,860
And if I select this, well, A, before I select it, you'll notice it's kind of present as you bounce around different things where it thinks it can help you.

227
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,020
It's got suggestions about how AI could interact with you.

228
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:59,940
If I just select Copilot, what this is going to do, it has context around what I'm currently looking at in the portal.

229
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,620
So in this case, I'm looking at storage, so it's suggesting storage things.

230
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:25,580
And it's also grounded, i.e., knowledge it can go and hook into about the Microsoft documentation, so all that learn stuff it knows about as well, but it's really important to understand it can only see and act on the things you, the person signed in.

231
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,420
can see and act on.

232
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:35,420
So all of those role-based access controls, so role-based access control are the permissions that I have on a certain scope.

233
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:40,940
Subscription, resource group, resource, it's going to live within whatever policies you have.

234
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,460
They're still going to be honored as well.

235
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,180
Any locks, they're all going to be respected and enforced as part of this.

236
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,700
So this is just the model

237
00:19:51,260 --> 00:20:00,620
is going to be sent context about what I'm currently doing, and it's also going to be able to go and search the documentation to help you with the things you're doing.

238
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:10,220
Some different resources have also created extra plug-ins, so it's even more useful for things like VMs and AKS to just help you do what you're trying to do.

239
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:20,940
But in this case, for example, I could A, ask it about the things I'm currently looking at in this context, but I can also just interact with it in general.

240
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:34,180
So I can say, hey, should I use Express Route Private Peering or a site-to-site VPN?

241
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:44,860
And so what it's doing now is it's looking at the documentation, it's looking at its pre-trained knowledge, but it's mainly going to ground itself in the documentation.

242
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,700
So it's going to ask me some questions.

243
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,460
Oh, okay.

244
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:57,900
So it's not just going to explain basic things, it's actually going to clarify and guide me through so it can give me the best information.

245
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,740
So now it's telling me the difference between them.

246
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,140
And hey, okay, if I want a more robust, consistent connection, Express Route would be the optimal.

247
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,460
Great.

248
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,460
Maybe I've heard about something new.

249
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,180
So what is NAT Gateway V2?

250
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,660
Like what's different about NAT Gateway V2?

251
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,020
And while it's doing this, realize I could also ask it to help me troubleshoot.

252
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,620
Why can't I do this, that, or the other?

253
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,340
Like it will guide me through steps.

254
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,140
It will look at information that I have access to and help me.

255
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,580
Okay, yeah, zone redundancy, oh yeah, performance, IPv6, great.

256
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,340
It can do more advanced things.

257
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:42,580
Can you help me create a script to set tag?

258
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,940
department to a value for all resources in a certain resource group.

259
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:59,100
So now it can actually go away and it will create me script to perform that function.

260
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,100
I could then go and iterate on it.

261
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,260
I could do whatever I want, but it's there to help me do different things.

262
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,020
That's the whole point of everything.

263
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,380
And you'll notice also on some of these,

264
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,420
it will actually go and then actually give me other suggestions.

265
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,580
So okay, it's asking me for a bit more detail and it will actually go and create the script.

266
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,740
But it's also suggesting other things and other ways it could help.

267
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,420
And of course also you can just think about regular AI.

268
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,180
So then you have the idea of things like just copilot.microsoft.com.

269
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,100
So this is the public version.

270
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,900
So I could ask it more general question, but this is only going to be grounded on public knowledge.

271
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,740
It cannot see your work resources.

272
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,820
It cannot see my Azure things.

273
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,820
But I might just help ask it to interact on more general research things, things I'm trying to learn.

274
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,660
I would not copy work information into this or attach it.

275
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,740
You should use your work's copilot, for example, or use Azure Copilot for those type things.

276
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:10,220
So always be careful with more generalized AIs that you don't send it work specific.

277
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:18,900
If you wouldn't be comfortable with information just being used to train things, you should not put it into general AI models.

278
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,660
Use your work versions of the services to get that sort of confidentiality.

279
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,900
I also create a sort of roughly 2 hour annual state of the unit.

280
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,540
I'm about to create my new version right now.

281
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,740
but that can give you a good overview of Azure.

282
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:42,540
I think if you are starting out, then I would probably think about the certifications can be useful.

283
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:54,940
You don't maybe need the certifications, but from a fundamentals perspective, my AZ-900 will guide you through core knowledge.

284
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:02,940
just about Azure, some of the basics around the key services, some of the basics around, okay, what is the subscription, how do I use it?

285
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:19,740
I have on my little learn site, so if I jump over for a second, I talk about sort of how to use Azure for free, but I've got an AZ-900 fundamentals course, so it's 9 1/2 hours.

286
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,500
Then I have a study cram.

287
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,980
And then I walk through the exam simulator, which is really, really good.

288
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:36,940
If you're going to take the exams, there's actually a sandbox, so you can get used to actually trying out what the exam environment would look like.

289
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,460
So that can help.

290
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:47,980
And then I go into a much deeper, I've got an Azure master class that's like 9 and a half, maybe it's even 20 hours long, of much deeper information.

291
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,340
Again, use Microsoft Learn.

292
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,340
It's fantastic.

293
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,700
It has really good documentation, really good training exercises.

294
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,700
I would also probably recommend doing the SC900.

295
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,180
That's kind of a core security one.

296
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,260
And also I would do AI900.

297
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,220
AI is everywhere.

298
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,860
I think those would be considered the core ones.

299
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,700
I mean, honestly, I know some people go and do all of the 900s.

300
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,100
They're all the fundamental ones.

301
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,540
There's obviously data.

302
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,540
There's more about co-pilots.

303
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,540
There's Power Platform.

304
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,660
They're really good things to have.

305
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:34,860
And then you can actually think about going to maybe say more specific, maybe Azure Administrator, maybe I want to go into an architect, maybe I want to go into a deeper set of AI capabilities, maybe DevOps and what they actually have.

306
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:45,300
And I link this in my site, but there is actually a poster just find it.

307
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,620
I'll scroll it from here.

308
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:56,860
So there is a certification poster that walks through all of the different certifications.

309
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,780
So you could see cloud, AI, security, and it talks about the fundamental ones first.

310
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:10,820
So the AZ, the AI, the data, and then the newer one is the ABH, the study cram on that power platform.

311
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,740
But then you could start to dive into more specific ones, and obviously they get more complex.

312
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:30,220
And so you get to sort of the advanced ones that tend to go deeper into certain functions, but really nice, clear path of the things that I may want to actually go and look at.

313
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,580
Now, Azure changes very, very frequently.

314
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:44,540
Microsoft do have an Azure update blog where they sort of post about the changes and what's coming out, and that's why I do kind of a weekly update.

315
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:52,540
So one of the things that I have on my channel is I actually have an update every week, every Friday.

316
00:26:53,180 --> 00:27:00,220
I put out an Azure update where I cover Azure things, but also entry things, but also AI things, also things that kind of surround it.

317
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:06,220
It's normally like 10 minutes or less, but it's a way to kind of stay current on the various things.

318
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,020
But just it's the cloud.

319
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,380
The cloud is evergreen.

320
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,900
It's constantly changing, constantly new features, constantly new services.

321
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:21,340
So you want to stay up to date because the way you solve something today, tomorrow, there may be another option available to you.

322
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:32,620
And it doesn't mean you change to it, but you just know it's there and maybe there's some time where you reevaluate how you do things or you have a new project, you can use the most effective, efficient service.

323
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:39,020
So I think really the key point here is get those fundamental things understood.

324
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,940
Get access to a subscription so you can get hands-on.

325
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,620
Try things out.

326
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,660
Set yourselves little projects.

327
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,700
Go through the labs.

328
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:52,060
Maybe follow the certifications to give you just a guided set of things to go and look at.

329
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,380
Stay current.

330
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,180
And AI can be your friend here.

331
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,900
AI, you can ask it to explain things with you.

332
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,180
can ask it to role play.

333
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,740
You can help troubleshoot things with it.

334
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,300
It's just a really great time to learn.

335
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,140
There's so many different ways to learn things.

336
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,740
And I hope that was useful.

337
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,980
And until the next video, take care.
