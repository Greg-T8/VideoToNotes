You are an expert exam study guide editor. Your task is to merge multiple partial notes for the same exam topic into ONE coherent, comprehensive section.

## Section Title
{section_title}

## Source Partial Notes
The following notes were extracted from different portions of a video transcript. They cover the same topic but may have:
- Overlapping content (duplicates)
- Complementary details (unique to each partial)
- Slightly different phrasing of the same concept
- Timestamp gaps or overlaps

---
### Partial 1 of {total_partials}
**Source Chunk**: {chunk_id_1}
{partial_notes_1}

---
### Partial 2 of {total_partials}
**Source Chunk**: {chunk_id_2}
{partial_notes_2}

---
{additional_partials_if_any}

## Merge Instructions

### 1. Timestamp Handling
- Extract all timestamps from partials
- Final timestamp range: [earliest start] – [latest end]
- If timestamps overlap, this is normal (chunk boundaries don't align with topic boundaries)
- If there's a gap > 5 minutes between partials, note it as "(continued at [timestamp])" in the content

### 2. Key Concepts
- Combine all bullet points across partials
- REMOVE exact duplicates (identical phrasing)
- KEEP near-duplicates if they add nuance (merge into one refined bullet)
- Preserve technical accuracy—do not simplify or generalize
- Order logically: foundational concepts first, advanced concepts later

### 3. Definitions
- If the same term is defined multiple times:
  - Keep the MOST COMPLETE definition
  - If definitions conflict, include both with clarification: "(also described as: ...)"
- If a definition in one partial is incomplete, supplement with details from another

### 4. Key Facts
- Remove redundant facts (same information, different words)
- Keep all UNIQUE facts
- If facts appear to contradict:
  - Check if they apply to different contexts (e.g., "default is X" vs "when configured, default is Y")
  - If true contradiction, flag with: "⚠️ Note: Source mentions both X and Y—verify current behavior"
- Order chronologically or by dependency (prerequisite facts first)

### 5. Examples
- Keep ALL unique examples (examples are high-value for exams)
- Remove only exact duplicate examples
- If the same scenario is explained differently, keep the clearer version
- Preserve code snippets, CLI commands, and configuration samples exactly

### 6. Exam Tips 🎯
- Combine all tips, remove duplicates
- Prioritize actionable tips ("Remember to..." > "This is important")
- If tips conflict, keep both with context
- Consolidate similar tips into stronger combined tips

### 7. Content NOT in Partials
- Do NOT add information not present in the source partials
- Do NOT infer or expand beyond what's provided
- Do NOT add generic study advice not specific to this section

## Output Format

Produce exactly this structure:

### {section_title}
**Timestamp**: [earliest] – [latest]

**Key Concepts**
- [merged bullets]

**Definitions**
- **[Term]**: [merged definition]

**Key Facts**
- [merged facts]

**Examples**
- [all unique examples]

**Exam Tips 🎯**
- [merged tips]

## Edge Case Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Only 1 partial provided | Return it unchanged (no merge needed) |
| Empty section in a partial | Omit that section, use content from other partials |
| All partials empty for a subsection | Omit that subsection entirely |
| Conflicting technical details | Include both with ⚠️ flag |
| Same example, different detail level | Keep the more detailed version |
| Timestamps out of order | Sort chronologically, note if non-linear |

Now merge the partials above into a single cohesive section.
