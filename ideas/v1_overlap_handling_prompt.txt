## Special Handling: High Overlap Detected

These partials have ~{overlap_percentage}% content overlap due to chunk boundary placement.

### Partial 1 (Chunk 4)
**Timestamps**: 12:00 – 15:30
{partial_1}

### Partial 2 (Chunk 5)
**Timestamps**: 14:45 – 18:20
{partial_2}

## Overlap Resolution Rules

1. For overlapping timestamp ranges (14:45–15:30 in this case):
   - Content in this range may appear in both partials
   - Deduplicate aggressively—keep ONE version of each point

2. If the same bullet appears twice with minor wording differences:
   - Choose the more precise/complete version
   - Do NOT create two similar bullets

3. Timestamp output should be: 12:00 – 18:20 (full span, no gap notation)

Merge with aggressive deduplication.
