## Conflict Resolution Rules

1. **Version/Date Conflicts**
   - If one partial mentions a version and another doesn't, keep the versioned info
   - Example: "In Azure CLI 2.50+" vs general statement → keep version-specific

2. **Default Value Conflicts**
   - Often context-dependent: "default is X" (portal) vs "default is Y" (CLI)
   - Merge as: "Default: X (portal), Y (CLI)" or flag for verification

3. **Behavioral Conflicts**
   - If instructor corrects themselves later: "**Correction**: Initially stated X, but later clarified Y"
   - If genuinely conflicting with no resolution: flag with ⚠️

4. **Terminology Conflicts**
   - Same concept, different names: include both as aliases
   - Example: "Storage Account (also called: storage resource, blob account)"

Apply these rules and merge, flagging any unresolved conflicts.
