Data Scientist path is harder.  \n- Study time varies by experience:  \n  - Beginners: 20-30 hours  \n  - Intermediate (have AI-900 or DP-900): 8-10 hours  \n  - Experienced cloud users: ~5 hours or less  \n- Recommended study approach: 50% lectures/labs, 50% practice exams, studying 30-60 minutes daily for 14 days.  \n- Hands-on labs reinforce learning but watching videos alone can suffice for AI-900. Labs may incur small Azure costs if compute instances are used.  \n- Practice exams are highly recommended for Azure certifications due to their difficulty and scaled scoring.  \n- Exam format:  \n  - 37-47 questions  \n  - Multiple choice, multiple answer, drag and drop, hot area question types  \n  - No case studies  \n  - No penalty for wrong answers  \n  - Passing score: 700/1000 (~70%)  \n  - Duration: 60 minutes exam time, 90 minutes total including instructions and NDA  \n- Exam can be taken online (proctored) or in person at test centers (e.g., CERA, Pearson VUE). In-person preferred for controlled environment.  \n- Microsoft fundamental certifications like AI-900 do not expire as long as technology remains relevant.  \n\n**Definitions**  \n- **AI-900**: Azure AI Fundamentals certification exam code.  \n- **Proctor**: A supervisor monitoring the exam session.  \n- **Scaled scoring**: Scoring system where questions may have different weights, and raw percentage may not directly translate to pass/fail.  \n- **C time**: Total time allocated for exam including instructions, NDA, exam, and feedback.  \n\n**Key Facts**  \n- AI-900 exam domains and weighting:  \n  - Describe AI workloads and considerations: 15-20%  \n  - Describe fundamental principles of machine learning on Azure: 20-25%  \n  - Describe features of computer vision workloads on Azure: 15-20%  \n  - Describe features of natural language processing workloads on Azure: 15-20%  \n  - Describe features of generative AI workloads on Azure: 15-20%  \n- Passing grade: 700/1000  \n- Exam length: 60 minutes  \n- Question count: 37-47  \n- No penalty for incorrect answers  \n\n**Examples**  \n- Pairing AI-900 with DP-900 for foundational knowledge.  \n- Using Azure AI Studio and Azure ML pipelines in labs.  \n- Practice exams available on Exam Pro platform (free and paid).  \n\n**Exam Tips \ud83c\udfaf**  \n- Focus on understanding and describing concepts rather than deep technical implementation.  \n- Use practice exams to familiarize with question formats and scaled scoring.  \n- Balance study time between lectures, labs, and practice exams.  \n- Be aware of the five exam domains and their approximate weightings.  \n- Know the difference between AI Engineer and Data Scientist paths and choose accordingly.  \n- Understand that AI-900 is foundational and does not require deep ML expertise.  \n- Remember Microsoft fundamental certifications do not expire.  \n- Prefer in-person exam if possible for less stress and controlled environment.  \n\n---\n\n"
