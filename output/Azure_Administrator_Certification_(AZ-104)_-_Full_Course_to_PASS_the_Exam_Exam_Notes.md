- Domains organize AD objects logically, similar to Azure resource groups.  
- Domain controllers authenticate users and authorize access, often deployed redundantly.  
- AD objects include users, groups, computers, printers, shared folders, etc.  
- Group Policy Objects (GPOs) control policy settings and access permissions for AD objects.  
- Organizational Units (OUs) are subdivisions within AD for further logical grouping of objects.  
- Directory services store and provide access to directory data, running on domain controllers.  
- A tenant represents an organization in Azure AD and is created automatically with Azure, Intune, or Microsoft 365 sign-up.

**Definitions**  
- **Domain**: A logical grouping of Active Directory objects on a network, organized by a single authentication database.  
- **Domain Controller**: A server that authenticates user identities and authorizes access to resources; multiple domain controllers provide redundancy and availability.  
- **Domain Computer**: A computer registered with the central authentication database; considered an AD object.  
- **AD Object**: The basic element in Active Directory such as users, groups, computers, printers, shared folders, etc.  
- **Group Policy Object (GPO)**: A virtual collection of policy settings that controls what an AD object can access.  
- **Organizational Unit (OU)**: A subdivision within Active Directory used to group users, groups, computers, and other OUs logically.  
- **Directory Service**: A service that stores directory data and makes it available to network users and administrators; runs on domain controllers.  
- **Tenant**: Represents an organization in Azure AD; each tenant is distinct and created automatically when signing up for Azure, Intune, or Microsoft 365.

**Key Facts**  
- Domains are logical groupings similar to Azure resource groups but for AD objects.  
- Multiple domain controllers are common to ensure redundancy and availability.  
- A tenant has a unique tenant ID and is tied to the Azure AD service instance.  
- Tenants are separate and distinct from each other.  
- Example tenant shown: "ExamPro" tenant licensed for Office 365 tier of Azure AD.

**Examples**  
- Domain controller redundancy allows users to log in from different locations.  
- Tenant example: "ExamPro" tenant with its own tenant ID and Office 365 licensing.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the role and purpose of domains, domain controllers, and AD objects as foundational AD concepts.  
- Know that Group Policy Objects and Organizational Units help manage and organize AD objects and their permissions.  
- Remember that directory services run on domain controllers to provide authentication and directory data access.  
- Recognize that an Azure AD tenant represents an organization and is created automatically with Microsoft cloud services sign-up.  
- While Azure exams focus more on Azure AD, familiarity with traditional AD terminology helps in understanding documentation and hybrid environments.

### Tenant

**Timestamp**: 00:25:54 – 00:26:42

**Key Concepts**  
- A tenant represents an organization within Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).  
- Each tenant is dedicated to a single Azure AD service instance.  
- Tenants are distinct and separate from one another.  
- A tenant is automatically created when signing up for Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft 365.  
- Tenant information includes a unique tenant ID and licensing details (e.g., Office 365 tier).  
- Azure AD provides a domain controller for authentication, but enterprises may choose to set up their own domain controller if needed.

**Definitions**  
- **Tenant**: An organization’s dedicated instance within Azure Active Directory, created automatically upon subscription to Microsoft cloud services.  
- **Domain Controller**: The server responsible for authenticating users to the directory service.

**Key Facts**  
- Each Azure AD tenant has a unique tenant ID.  
- Tenants are licensed for specific service tiers, such as Office 365.  
- Azure automatically sets up a domain controller when creating an Active Directory in the cloud.  
- Enterprises with existing on-premises Active Directory may migrate to Azure AD for a fully managed cloud directory but might need to maintain their own domain controller for certain domain services not available in Azure AD.

**Examples**  
- The speaker’s tenant named "ExamPro one" with its own tenant ID and licensed for Office 365.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember that a tenant is the fundamental organizational unit in Azure AD and is created automatically with Microsoft cloud subscriptions.  
- Each tenant is isolated and has its own unique tenant ID.  
- Understanding tenant licensing (e.g., Office 365) helps identify the Azure AD service tier in use.  
- Know that Azure AD provides domain controllers by default, but enterprises may need to deploy their own domain controllers to support features not available in Azure AD’s managed domain services.

### AD DS

**Timestamp**: 00:26:42 – 00:27:51

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) provide managed domain services in the cloud.  
- Azure AD DS supports domain joins, group policies, LDAP, and NTLM authentication.  
- Azure AD DS eliminates the need to deploy, manage, or patch domain controllers manually.  
- Organizations with existing on-premises Active Directory can move to Azure AD for a fully managed cloud directory but may need Azure AD DS for full domain controller features.

**Definitions**  
- **Domain Controller**: A server that users authenticate against to access directory services.  
- **Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS)**: A managed domain service in Azure that provides traditional domain controller features without the need for manual deployment or management.

**Key Facts**  
- Azure sets up an Active Directory automatically, but enterprises may choose to set up their own domain controller in Azure for full feature support.  
- Azure AD DS supports key domain services such as domain join, group policies, LDAP, and NTLM authentication.  
- Azure AD DS is fully managed by Azure, meaning no manual patching or management is required.

**Examples**  
- An enterprise with an existing on-premises Active Directory may move to Azure AD but still require Azure AD DS to access domain controller features not available in the default Azure AD setup.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the difference between Azure AD and Azure AD DS: Azure AD is primarily identity management, while Azure AD DS provides traditional domain controller capabilities in a managed service.  
- Remember that Azure AD DS supports legacy authentication protocols like NTLM and LDAP, which are not natively supported in Azure AD alone.  
- For exam scenarios involving hybrid or cloud migrations, know when to use Azure AD DS to maintain domain services without managing domain controllers yourself.

- Users can be added to groups to simplify permission management.  
- Authentication enforcement (e.g., MFA) can be applied to users.  
- User sign-ins and device access can be tracked and managed.  
- Microsoft licenses can be assigned to users.  
- Azure AD distinguishes between two types of users: organizational users and guest users from other organizations.  
- Groups allow resource owners to assign access permissions collectively rather than individually.  
- Group owners manage membership and permissions within groups.  
- Roles and applications can be assigned directly to groups.  
- Group owners can enable self-service group joining with options for automatic acceptance or approval.

**Definitions**  
- **User**: An identity representing a person or employee in a domain, with credentials to log into Azure portal.  
- **Guest User**: A user from an external organization invited to access resources.  
- **Group Owner**: A user with permissions to add or remove members from a group.  
- **Group Member**: A user who has rights to perform actions as assigned within the group.

**Key Facts**  
- Users can be tracked for sign-in activity and device usage.  
- Groups can contain owners and members with distinct permission levels.  
- Assigning roles or applications to groups simplifies access management.  
- Self-service group joining reduces administrative overhead.

**Examples**  
- The presenter shows their own user account with login counts and group memberships in Azure AD.  
- Groups in "Exam Pro" contain owners who manage membership and members who have assigned rights.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember that users are the fundamental identity objects in Azure AD with credentials and access rights.  
- Distinguish between organizational users and guest users for access scenarios.  
- Use groups to efficiently manage permissions and role assignments at scale.  
- Leverage group owners and self-service group joining to reduce manual administrative tasks.  
- Track user sign-ins and device access to maintain security and compliance.

- Groups in Azure AD allow resource owners to assign access permissions collectively to all group members.  
- Groups can have owners and members; owners manage group membership, members receive assigned rights.  
- Roles and applications can be assigned directly to groups.  
- Group owners can enable users to request to join groups, with options for automatic acceptance or approval required.

**Definitions**  
- **Group Owner**: A user with permissions to add or remove members from the group.  
- **Group Member**: A user who belongs to the group and inherits the access permissions assigned to the group.

**Key Facts**  
- Assigning permissions to groups avoids the need to assign rights individually to each user.  
- Group owners can configure join settings to allow self-service group membership requests.  
- Role and application assignments can be made directly to groups, simplifying access management.

**Examples**  
- Example given: In the "Exam Pro" tenant, multiple groups exist with owners and members managing access.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember that groups streamline access management by bundling permissions for multiple users.  
- Know that group owners control membership and can set join policies to reduce administrative overhead.  
- Understand that roles and applications can be assigned at the group level, not just to individual users.  
- Be familiar with the concept of self-service group joining and approval workflows as a practical feature.

### Assign Access Rights

**Timestamp**: 00:30:53 – 00:31:38

**Key Concepts**  
- There are four different ways to assign users rights to access resources in Azure AD.  
- Access can be assigned directly to users or indirectly via groups or rules.  
- External authorities can also provide access rights.

**Definitions**  
- **Direct Assignment**: The resource owner assigns access rights directly to an individual user.  
- **Group Assignment**: The resource owner assigns access rights to a group, automatically granting access to all group members.  
- **Rule-Based Assignment**: The resource owner creates a group and uses rules to dynamically assign users to the resource based on criteria.  
- **External Authority Assignment**: Access rights are granted based on an external source such as an on-premises directory or SaaS application.

**Key Facts**  
- Four methods to assign access rights: Direct, Group, Rule-based, External authority.  
- Group assignment simplifies management by granting access to all members of a group at once.  
- Rule-based assignment automates user membership in groups based on defined rules.  
- External authority assignment integrates external identity providers or directories for access control.

**Examples**  
- None specifically mentioned in this segment.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the four methods of assigning access rights and when to use each.  
- Group assignment is efficient for managing multiple users at once.  
- Rule-based assignment helps automate access based on user attributes or conditions.  
- External authority assignment is important for hybrid or SaaS environments integrating external identities.  
- Be prepared to identify and differentiate these assignment methods on the exam.

- Supports collaboration with partners, distributors, suppliers, vendors, and other guests.  
- Allows sharing of apps with external users (B2B scenarios).  
- Supports development of apps for Azure AD tenants (single-tenant or multi-tenant).  
- Azure AD B2C enables creation of white-label apps for consumers and customers.

**Definitions**  
- **External Identities**: Azure AD feature that allows external users to access organizational resources using their own identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).  
- **Azure AD B2C**: A service to develop consumer-facing applications that allow users to sign in with social or local accounts.

**Key Facts**  
- External identities can come from social identity providers like Google or Facebook.  
- External identities facilitate business-to-business (B2B) collaboration.  
- Azure AD supports both single-tenant and multi-tenant app development for external access.

**Examples**  
- Partners, distributors, suppliers, vendors accessing resources using their own identities.  
- Sharing apps with external users for B2B purposes.  
- Developing white-label consumer apps using Azure AD B2C.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**

### Create a Tenant

**Timestamp**: 00:32:17 – 00:35:14

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants are logical containers grouping users within an organization.  
- A tenant is essentially an instance of Azure Active Directory.  
- You can create multiple tenants to represent different organizations or isolated environments.  
- There are two main types of tenants: B2B (Business to Business) and B2C (Business to Consumer).  
- B2B tenants allow collaboration between different businesses.  
- B2C tenants enable users to access consumer-facing applications and share administration experiences.  
- When creating a tenant, you must provide a unique organization name and initial domain name.  
- The initial domain is appended with “.onmicrosoft.com” (not Microsoft.com as misstated in the transcript).  
- The tenant’s default location can be set (e.g., Canada), but data center deployment is typically in the US.  
- Tenant creation requires a unique domain name; if the chosen name is taken, you must try alternatives.  

**Definitions**  
- **Tenant**: An instance of Azure Active Directory that logically groups users and resources for an organization.  
- **B2B (Business to Business)**: Tenant type that facilitates collaboration between multiple organizations.  
- **B2C (Business to Consumer)**: Tenant type designed for consumer-facing applications allowing external users to access services.  

**Key Facts**  
- Every Azure account starts with a single default tenant representing your organization.  
- Tenant names and initial domains must be unique across Azure AD.  
- The initial domain uses the format: `[chosenname].onmicrosoft.com`.  
- Tenant creation can take a few minutes to complete.  
- Location selection affects defaults but does not necessarily change the physical data center location.  

**Examples**  
- Created a tenant named “Starfleet” but had to modify the domain name multiple times due to naming conflicts (e.g., tried “USS Starfleet” but it was invalid due to characters, ended with “Starfleet1984”).  
- Switched between multiple tenants such as “Hushnook,” “ExamPro,” and “Starfleet” to isolate users per tenant.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand that tenants are the fundamental boundary for users and resources in Azure AD.  
- Know the difference between B2B and B2C tenants and their use cases.  
- When creating a tenant, ensure the organization name and domain are unique and valid (no special characters, numeric allowed).  
- Tenant creation is done via the Azure portal under Azure Active Directory > Manage tenants.  
- You can switch between tenants in the portal to manage different isolated environments.  
- Remember that the initial domain ends with “.onmicrosoft.com” and must be unique globally.  
- Tenant location setting is mostly for administrative purposes; actual data center location may differ.  
- Practice creating tenants to get familiar with naming constraints and the creation workflow.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always create groups before users to simplify user management and access assignment.  
- Understand the difference between security groups and Microsoft 365 groups for correct usage.  
- Dynamic groups require Azure AD Premium P2; know your licensing limitations.  
- Auto-generated passwords are temporary; users must reset them on first login.  
- Deleted users and groups can be restored within 30 days—useful for accidental deletions.  
- Tenant context is important—always verify which tenant you are working in before making changes.

---

### Guest Users

**Timestamp**: 00:41:39 – 00:43:53

**Key Concepts**  
- Guest users allow inviting users from other Azure AD tenants into your tenant.  
- Inviting guest users is simpler than setting up federation between Active Directories.  
- Federation involves joining multiple Active Directories (on-premises or external), which has significant administrative overhead.  
- Azure AD guest user invitations are done via email and can be assigned to groups and roles.  

**Definitions**  
- **Guest User**: A user invited from an external Azure AD tenant to collaborate within your tenant without needing federation.  
- **Federation**: The process of linking two or more Active Directories to allow shared authentication and access, typically complex and administratively heavy.  

**Key Facts**  
- Guest users show up in the tenant’s user list marked as "guest."  
- Invitations to guest users are sent via email.  
- Guest user creation can be done through the Azure portal under "Users" → "New guest user."  
- You can assign guest users to groups and roles just like regular users.  

**Examples**  
- Created a user named "Hushnook" in one tenant (Hushnuk one) with email hushnook@microsoft.com.  
- Switched to another tenant (Starfleet) and invited "Hushnook" as a guest user by entering their email and sending an invitation.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember that guest users simplify cross-tenant collaboration without federation complexity.  
- Guest users must be invited via their email address and will receive an invitation to join.  
- Guest users appear distinctly as "guest" in the user list.  
- Assigning groups and roles to guest users works the same as for internal users.  
- Federation is more complex and generally avoided if all parties use Azure AD.

### MFA

**Timestamp**: 00:46:45 – 00:50:51

**Key Concepts**  
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds a secondary step to confirm user identity during login.  
- MFA can be enabled per user or in bulk for multiple users.  
- MFA options include phone call, text message, mobile app notification, verification codes, and hardware tokens (e.g., UbiKey).  
- App passwords allow users to sign into non-browser apps when MFA is enabled.  
- Trusted IP addresses can be whitelisted to bypass MFA prompts.  
- MFA enforcement can require users to create app passwords for non-browser apps.  
- Remember MFA on trusted devices can be configured for a set number of days to reduce repeated prompts.

**Definitions**  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: A security process requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource, enhancing account security beyond just a password.  
- **App Passwords**: Special passwords generated to allow non-browser applications (like Outlook or Lynx) to authenticate when MFA is enabled.  
- **Hardware Token**: A physical device (e.g., UbiKey) used as a second factor for authentication.

**Key Facts**  
- MFA is often disabled by default, especially on free Azure AD versions.  
- Azure AD Premium P2 license is required to enable MFA features fully.  
- Verification options include:  
  - Call to phone (user receives a call and enters letters/numbers)  
  - Text message  
  - Mobile app notification (via companion app on Android, iOS, Windows)  
  - Verification code from mobile app or hardware token  
- Bulk enabling MFA can be done by downloading a sample CSV file, editing user MFA status, and uploading it back.  
- Enforcing MFA means users must create app passwords for non-browser apps.  
- Remember MFA on trusted devices can be set for a custom number of days or disabled for maximum security.

**Examples**  
- Enabling MFA for a single user named Kevin by clicking "Enable" next to his name.  
- Bulk update example: downloading a sample file, pasting user names and MFA status, then uploading it to enable MFA for multiple users.  
- Using a UbiKey as a hardware token for MFA.  
- Enforcing MFA so users must create app passwords to use Outlook or Lynx.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Know that MFA adds an essential security layer beyond passwords and is highly recommended.  
- Understand the different verification methods available and when hardware tokens might be used.  
- Remember that Azure AD Premium P2 is required for full MFA capabilities; free tiers may not support it.  
- Be familiar with the process to enable MFA both individually and in bulk.  
- App passwords are necessary for non-browser apps once MFA is enforced.  
- Consider the trade-off between user convenience (remember MFA on trusted devices) and security (require MFA every time).  
- Enforcing MFA is a best practice to ensure users comply with security policies.

- Wildcards (*) can be used in Actions, NotActions, DataActions, and NotDataActions to match all permissions in that category.

**Examples**  
- The transcript references a JSON example of a role definition (not fully shown) and notes that PowerShell uses slightly different property names (e.g., "Name" vs. "RoleName").  
- Example of wildcard usage: Using "*" in actions to represent all operations like read, write, delete, run, etc., within a category such as cost management.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always review built-in managed roles to understand what permissions they grant instead of relying solely on the role name.  
- Custom roles require Azure AD Premium P1 or P2, so plan licensing accordingly.  
- Understand the difference between Actions and NotActions to effectively design roles with appropriate permissions and restrictions.  
- Use wildcards carefully to avoid overly broad permissions.  
- Remember that Azure roles control access (who can do what), whereas Azure policies enforce compliance (what state resources must be in).  
- Be familiar with the syntax differences between JSON and PowerShell role definitions for exam scenarios.

### Policies vs RBAC

**Timestamp**: 01:24:21 – 01:25:35

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure Policies ensure compliance of resources by evaluating resource states against business rules.  
- Azure Roles (RBAC) control access to Azure resources by managing user actions and applying restrictions.  
- Policies evaluate resource properties and do not restrict actions directly.  
- RBAC focuses on restricting what actions users can perform at various scopes.  
- Even if a user has permission to perform an action, Azure Policy can block the action if it results in a non-compliant resource.

**Definitions**  
- **Azure Policies**: Tools used to enforce compliance by evaluating resource states and ensuring they meet organizational standards, regardless of who performs the action.  
- **Azure Roles (RBAC)**: Role-based access control mechanisms that manage and restrict user permissions to perform actions on Azure resources.

**Key Facts**  
- Azure Policies examine properties of resources represented in Azure Resource Manager and some resource providers.  
- Policies do not restrict operations (actions) but enforce compliance by blocking non-compliant resource creation or updates.  
- RBAC restricts user actions at different scopes within Azure resources.  
- Azure Policies and RBAC serve complementary but distinct purposes: compliance vs access control.

**Examples**  
- None mentioned explicitly in this section.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember that Azure Policies focus on *what* state a resource should be in (compliance), not *who* can do what.  
- RBAC controls *who* can perform *which* actions on Azure resources.  
- Even with RBAC permissions, Azure Policy can block changes if they violate compliance rules.  
- Policies and RBAC work together to ensure secure and compliant resource management in Azure.

### AD Roles vs RBAC

**Timestamp**: 01:25:35 – 01:26:50

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure AD roles control access to Azure Active Directory resources.  
- Azure roles (RBAC) control access to Azure resources.  
- AD roles and Azure roles operate independently by default and do not span across each other’s domains.  
- Global Administrator in Azure AD does not have access to Azure resources by default.  
- Access to Azure resources for AD Global Administrators requires explicit assignment of an Azure role (e.g., User Access Administrator).  

**Definitions**  
- **Azure AD Roles**: Roles that manage permissions related to Azure Active Directory resources such as users, groups, billing, licensing, and application registrations.  
- **Azure Roles (RBAC)**: Role-Based Access Control roles that manage permissions on Azure resources like virtual machines, databases, storage, and networking.  

**Key Facts**  
- Azure AD roles focus on identity and directory-related resources.  
- Azure RBAC roles focus on managing access to Azure infrastructure and services.  
- The Global Administrator role in Azure AD does not inherently grant access to Azure resources.  
- To manage Azure resources, Global Administrators must be assigned an Azure RBAC role explicitly.  

**Examples**  
- AD resources: users, groups, billing, licensing, application registration.  
- Azure resources: virtual machines, databases, cloud storage, cloud networking.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the clear separation between Azure AD roles and Azure RBAC roles.  
- Remember that Azure AD roles do not grant access to Azure resources by default.  
- Know that Global Administrator access to Azure resources requires an additional Azure RBAC role assignment.  
- Be able to distinguish between managing identity-related resources (Azure AD roles) versus managing cloud infrastructure and services (Azure RBAC).  
- When studying IAM in Azure, differentiate between classic subscription administrator roles, Azure RBAC roles, and Azure AD roles.

### Roles CheatSheet

**Timestamp**: 01:26:50 – 01:28:32

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure has three types of roles related to Identity and Access Management (IAM):  
  1. Classic subscription administrator roles  
  2. Azure Roles (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC)  
  3. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles  
- Roles restrict access to resource actions (operations) by assigning permissions.  
- Role assignments consist of three components: security principal, role definition, and scope.  
- There are built-in roles and custom roles:  
  - Built-in roles are Microsoft-managed and often read-only or predefined (e.g., Owner, Contributor, Reader, User Access Administrator).  
  - Custom roles are user-created with custom permissions.  
- Classic administrator roles include Account Administrator, Service Administrator, and Co-administrator.  
- Important Azure AD roles include Global Administrator, User Administrator, and Billing Administrator.  
- Custom Azure AD roles require Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 licenses.  

**Definitions**  
- **Classic subscription administrator roles**: Legacy roles managing Azure subscriptions before RBAC was introduced.  
- **Azure Roles (RBAC)**: Role-Based Access Control roles built on Azure Resource Manager (ARM) to manage access to Azure resources.  
- **Azure AD roles**: Roles that manage permissions within Azure Active Directory, separate from Azure resource access.  
- **Role assignment**: The process of applying a role to a user, consisting of a security principal (user/group/service principal), role definition (permissions), and scope (resource level).  
- **Built-in roles**: Predefined roles provided by Microsoft for common access scenarios.  
- **Custom roles**: Roles created by users to tailor permissions beyond built-in roles.  

**Key Facts**  
- By default, Azure roles and Azure AD roles do NOT span across Azure and Azure AD.  
- The Global Administrator role in Azure AD does NOT have access to Azure resources by default.  
- Global Administrators can gain Azure resource access if assigned the User Access Administrator role in Azure RBAC.  
- Built-in Azure RBAC roles to know: Owner, Contributor, Reader, User Access Administrator.  
- Classic administrator roles to know: Account Administrator, Service Administrator, Co-administrator.  
- Important Azure AD roles to remember: Global Administrator, User Administrator, Billing Administrator.  
- Creating custom Azure AD roles requires Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 licenses.  

**Examples**  
- None specifically mentioned in this section.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the difference between classic subscription roles, Azure RBAC roles, and Azure AD roles.  
- Remember that Azure AD roles and Azure resource roles are separate and do not overlap by default.  
- Know the main built-in Azure RBAC roles and classic administrator roles for the exam.  
- Global Administrator in Azure AD does not automatically have Azure resource access—requires explicit role assignment.  
- Custom Azure AD roles require premium licensing (P1 or P2).  
- Be familiar with role assignments as the combination of security principal, role definition, and scope.

### Policy Definition File

**Timestamp**: 01:30:35 – 01:34:45

**Key Concepts**  
- Anatomy of an Azure Policy Definition file  
- Types of policies: built-in, custom, static  
- Components of a policy definition: display name, type, description, metadata, mode, parameters, policy rules  
- Policy modes: all, index, resource provider  
- Parameters allow flexibility in policies (types, metadata, default values, allowed values)  
- Policy rules structure: if-then logic with conditions and effects  
- Policy effects: deny, audit, append, auditIfNotExists, deployIfNotExists, disabled  

**Definitions**  
- **Built-in Policy**: Maintained by Microsoft.  
- **Custom Policy**: Created by the user.  
- **Static Policy**: Owned by Microsoft for regulatory compliance (e.g., HIPAA, FedRAMP).  
- **Mode**: Determines the scope of resources the policy applies to (e.g., all resources, only those supporting tags, or specific resource providers).  
- **Parameters**: Values passed into policies to make them flexible and reusable.  
- **Policy Rule**: Contains an "if" condition and a "then" effect that defines what happens when the condition is met.  
- **Policy Effects**: Actions taken when a policy condition is met, including:  
  - **Deny**: Blocks resource creation or update if non-compliant.  
  - **Audit**: Logs a warning event without blocking the request.  
  - **Append**: Adds additional fields (e.g., tags) during resource creation or update.  
  - **AuditIfNotExists**: Logs a warning if a related resource does not exist.  
  - **DeployIfNotExists**: Triggers a template deployment if a condition is met.  
  - **Disabled**: Ignores the policy rule, often used for testing.  

**Key Facts**  
- Display name describes the policy purpose and is usually descriptive enough.  
- Metadata is optional and can provide additional info about parameters.  
- Modes:  
  - **All**: Applies to all resource types including resource groups and subscriptions.  
  - **Index**: Applies only to resource types supporting tags and locations.  
  - **Resource Provider**: Limited scope, e.g., Microsoft.ContainerService.data (generally deprecated), Kubernetes data, Key Vault data.  
- Parameters can be of types: string, array, object, boolean, integer, float, etc.  
- Policy rules use logical operators to combine conditions.  
- Effects determine how Azure enforces or audits compliance.  

**Examples**  
- Policy rule example: If resource type is virtual machines, then apply the effect parameter to check health status.  
- Append effect example: Adding tags like cost center or allowed IPs to storage resources during creation or update.  
- DeployIfNotExists example: Running a template deployment to enable SQL encryption on a database after creation.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**

- Management groups allow grouping of subscriptions for organizational purposes.  
- Resource groups organize resources within a subscription.  

**Examples**  
- Management groups could be organized by domains such as development, business, or data science.  
- Resources examples include virtual machines, containers, databases, and storage.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the hierarchy: Management Group > Subscription > Resource Group > Resource.  
- Always associate resources with a subscription to enable billing and access controls.  
- Scopes are foundational for applying governance and role-based access controls in Azure.  
- Remember that subscriptions define billing and support agreements and are required before deploying resources.

---

### Subscriptions

**Timestamp**: 01:45:54 – 01:47:00

**Key Concepts**  
- A subscription is required before you can do anything in an Azure account.  
- Subscriptions define the billing plan for resources launched in Azure.  
- Multiple subscriptions can exist within one Azure account.  
- Common subscription types include Free Trial, Pay-As-You-Go, and Azure for Students.  
- Subscriptions allow management of resource tags and access controls.  
- Azure Management Groups enable hierarchical management of multiple subscriptions.  
- The Root Management Group is the top-level container for all subscriptions in a directory.  
- Subscriptions inherit policies and conditions applied to their management group.

**Definitions**  
- **Subscription**: A billing and management container in Azure that determines the plan and permissions for resources launched under it.  
- **Azure Management Group**: A hierarchical container that organizes multiple subscriptions and applies policies or access controls across them.  
- **Root Management Group**: The single top-level management group in an Azure directory that contains all other management groups and subscriptions.

**Key Facts**  
- You must have a subscription to launch any Azure resources.  
- There are multiple subscription types beyond the common three, e.g., developer support subscriptions require payment.  
- Access controls and resource tags can be set at the subscription level.  
- Management groups allow grouping of subscriptions by departments such as HR, IT, Marketing.  
- Subscriptions automatically inherit conditions from their parent management group.

**Examples**  
- Common subscription types: Free Trial, Pay-As-You-Go, Azure for Students.  
- Management groups example hierarchy: Root Management Group > Human Resources / IT / Marketing > Subscriptions > Resource Groups.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always remember that a subscription is mandatory to use Azure services and determines billing.  
- Understand the difference between subscriptions and management groups: subscriptions hold resources; management groups organize subscriptions.  
- Know the common subscription types and that more specialized subscriptions (like developer support) may require additional payment.  
- Policies and access controls can be applied at the subscription or management group level and are inherited down the hierarchy.  
- Be familiar with the hierarchical structure: Root Management Group at the top, then management groups, then subscriptions, then resource groups.

---

### Management Groups

**Timestamp**: 01:47:00 – 01:48:05

**Key Concepts**  
- Management Groups allow management of multiple Azure subscriptions within a hierarchical structure.  
- Each Azure directory has a single top-level management group called the Root Management Group.  
- Subscriptions inherit policies and access controls applied to their parent management group.  
- Hierarchical structure enables organizing subscriptions under management groups like HR, IT, Marketing.  
- Management groups create "choke points" to apply access controls and permissions efficiently across subscriptions.

**Definitions**  
- **Management Group**: A container that helps manage access, policies, and compliance across multiple Azure subscriptions in a hierarchy.  
- **Root Management Group**: The single top-level management group automatically created for each Azure directory, under which all other management groups and subscriptions reside.  
- **Subscription**: An Azure account that holds resources and is managed under management groups.  
- **Resource Group**: A container that holds related Azure resources (mentioned briefly as a further subdivision).

**Key Facts**  
- All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions (access controls, policies) applied at the management group level.  
- The hierarchy typically looks like: Root Management Group → Management Groups (e.g., HR, IT, Marketing) → Subscriptions → Resource Groups → Resources.  
- Access controls can be scoped to management groups to restrict user permissions effectively (e.g., marketing users only access billing info).

**Examples**  
- Example hierarchy: Root Management Group at the top, with child management groups such as Human Resources, IT, Marketing, each containing different subscriptions.  
- Access control example: Limiting marketing team users to only have access to billing information by applying permissions at the marketing management group level.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand that management groups provide centralized management for multiple subscriptions via a hierarchical structure.  
- Remember the Root Management Group is the top-level container for all management groups and subscriptions in a directory.  
- Policies and access controls applied at a management group level automatically flow down to all subscriptions beneath it.  
- Use management groups to enforce governance and security boundaries efficiently across large Azure environments.  
- Be able to distinguish between management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources in the Azure hierarchy.

### Resource Groups

**Timestamp**: 01:48:05 – 01:48:40

**Key Concepts**  
- Resource groups act as containers that hold related Azure resources.  
- Individual resources (e.g., virtual machines) reside within these resource groups.  
- Resource providers supply the actual Azure services/resources within these groups.

**Definitions**  
- **Resource Group**: A container that holds related Azure resources for management and organization.  
- **Resource**: An individual Azure service or component, such as a virtual machine.  
- **Resource Provider**: A service that supplies Azure resources (e.g., Microsoft.Compute provides compute resources like VMs).

**Key Facts**  
- Resource groups help organize and manage related resources collectively.  
- Resource providers must be registered in your Azure subscription to use their services.  
- Many resource providers are registered by default, enabling immediate use of common services.  

**Examples**  
- Visual example: multiple virtual machines grouped inside a single resource group.  
- Microsoft.Compute is an example of a resource provider supplying virtual machines.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand that resource groups are logical containers for related Azure resources.  
- Know that each resource belongs to a resource group.  
- Remember that resource providers must be registered to enable the use of specific Azure services.  
- Many providers come pre-registered, but some (like Kubernetes) may require manual registration.  
- Registration acts as a safeguard to control access to potentially costly or complex services.

### Resource Providers

**Timestamp**: 01:48:40 – 01:49:49

**Key Concepts**  
- Resource providers must be registered to use specific Azure resources.  
- Many resource providers come pre-registered by default in an Azure subscription.  
- Resource providers are services that supply Azure resources (e.g., Microsoft.Compute).  
- Registration acts as a control mechanism to enable or disable access to certain services.  

**Definitions**  
- **Resource Provider**: A service in Azure that supplies resources (such as virtual machines, storage, etc.) to a subscription.  
- **Registering a Resource Provider**: The process of enabling a resource provider within an Azure subscription to allow the use of its services.  

**Key Facts**  
- Some resource providers are registered automatically in a subscription, allowing immediate use of many Azure services.  
- If a service (e.g., Kubernetes) does not appear in search or documentation, it may be because its resource provider is not registered.  
- Users can manually register resource providers via the Azure subscription settings.  
- Registration is a safeguard to ensure users consciously enable potentially costly or complex services.  

**Examples**  
- Microsoft.Compute is an example of a resource provider that supplies compute resources like virtual machines.  
- Kubernetes resource provider might need manual registration if it does not appear by default.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always check if the required resource provider is registered before attempting to use a new Azure service.  
- If a service is missing in the Azure portal or search, verify and register the corresponding resource provider.  
- Understand that resource provider registration is a deliberate action to control service availability and cost management.  
- Familiarize yourself with common resource providers like Microsoft.Compute as foundational knowledge for Azure resource management.

### Resource Tags

**Timestamp**: 01:49:49 – 01:51:24

**Key Concepts**  
- Resource tags are key-value pairs assigned to Azure resources.  
- Tags help organize and manage Azure resources effectively.  
- Tags can be applied during resource creation via the tags page.  
- Tags support multiple organizational purposes including resource management, cost management, operations, and security.

**Definitions**  
- **Resource Tag (Tag)**: A key and value pair assigned to Azure resources to categorize and organize them.

**Key Facts**  
- Tags can represent attributes such as department, status, team, environment, project, or location.  
- Uses of tags include:  
  - Resource management (e.g., specifying workloads, environments like development)  
  - Cost management and optimization (e.g., cost tracking, budgets, alerts)  
  - Operations management (e.g., identifying mission-critical services, SLA commitments)  
  - Security classification (e.g., data classification, compliance requirements)  
  - Automation and workload optimization  

**Examples**  
- Department: Finance, IT, HR  
- Status: Approved  
- Environment: Development, Production  
- Project: ProjectX  
- Location: East US  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always consider applying tags to your Azure resources, especially in production environments.  
- Tags improve resource organization, cost tracking, and operational management.  
- Tags are a best practice for managing large-scale Azure deployments.  
- Even if not frequently used in demos or labs, tagging is critical for real-world Azure governance and management.

### Resource Locks

**Timestamp**: 01:51:24 – 01:52:04

**Key Concepts**  
- Resource locks are used to prevent accidental deletion or modification of critical Azure resources.  
- Locks can be applied at different scopes: subscription, resource group, or individual resource level.  
- There are two lock levels available in Azure Portal:  
  1. **CanNotDelete**  
  2. **ReadOnly**

**Definitions**  
- **Resource Lock**: A mechanism to restrict actions on Azure resources to protect them from accidental changes or deletion.  
- **CanNotDelete Lock**: Prevents deletion of the resource but still allows authorized users to read and modify it.  
- **ReadOnly Lock**: Allows authorized users to only read the resource; they cannot delete or update it.

**Key Facts**  
- Locks help maintain resource integrity by limiting destructive operations.  
- Even with locks, authorized users retain read access (in both lock modes).  
- The difference between the two lock levels is whether modification is allowed (CanNotDelete) or not (ReadOnly).

**Examples**  
- None mentioned explicitly, but implied use case: locking a subscription, resource group, or resource to avoid accidental deletion or modification.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Use resource locks to safeguard critical Azure resources from accidental deletion or modification.  
- Understand the difference between CanNotDelete (prevents deletion, allows modification) and ReadOnly (prevents deletion and modification).  
- Locks can be applied at multiple scopes depending on the level of protection needed.  
- Remember that locks do not prevent reading the resource; they only restrict delete/update operations.

---

### Blueprints

**Timestamp**: 01:52:04 – 01:54:06

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure Blueprints enable quick creation of governed subscriptions.  
- Governed subscriptions have predefined processes and expectations for setup.  
- Blueprints are reusable compositions of artifacts based on organizational patterns.  
- Blueprints provide a declarative way to orchestrate deployment of resources and configurations.  
- Artifacts in Blueprints can include role assignments, policy assignments, ARM templates, and resource groups.  
- Azure Blueprints are backed by globally distributed Azure Cosmos DB for replication and backup.  
- Blueprints maintain an active relationship between the blueprint definition and its assignments, allowing upgrades and multi-subscription management.  
- Blueprints support improved tracking and auditing of deployments compared to ARM templates.

**Definitions**  
- **Azure Blueprints**: A service that allows you to define a repeatable set of Azure resources and policies to create governed subscriptions with consistent environments.  
- **Declarative**: A method where the desired state is fully specified, so the system knows exactly what to create or configure.  
- **Artifact**: Components included in a blueprint such as role assignments, policy assignments, ARM templates, and resource groups.  
- **ARM Template**: Azure Resource Manager template, a JSON file that defines infrastructure and configuration for Azure resources.

**Key Facts**  
- Blueprints are stored and replicated globally using Azure Cosmos DB.  
- ARM templates can automate deployment but lack the active linkage and upgrade capabilities of Blueprints.  
- Blueprints can upgrade multiple subscriptions governed by the same blueprint simultaneously.  
- Blueprints provide better tracking and auditing features than standalone ARM templates.

**Examples**  
- None specifically mentioned beyond general artifact types (role assignments, policy assignments, ARM templates, resource groups).

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Use Azure Blueprints when you need governed, repeatable, and auditable subscription setups.  
- Blueprints are preferred over ARM templates alone for managing multiple subscriptions and upgrades.  
- Understand that Blueprints are declarative and backed by Cosmos DB for reliability and replication.  
- Remember the difference: ARM templates automate deployment but lack the governance and lifecycle management features of Blueprints.

### Moving Resources

**Timestamp**: 01:54:06 – 02:06:40

**Key Concepts**  
- Moving Azure resources between resource groups, regions, and subscriptions.  
- Limitations and edge cases when moving certain resource types (e.g., App Services, DevOps services, VMs).  
- Resource locks and their impact on modifying, deleting, and moving resources.  
- Behavior of moving resources into or out of resource groups with locks applied.  
- Deployment conflicts when moving resources during active deployments.  

**Definitions**  
- **Resource Group**: A container that holds related Azure resources for an Azure solution.  
- **Resource Lock**: A setting applied to a resource or resource group to prevent accidental modification or deletion. Types include:  
  - **Read-only lock**: Prevents any write operations (modifications) on the resource.  
  - **Delete lock**: Prevents deletion of the resource but allows modifications.  

**Key Facts**  
- Moving resources between resource groups can also involve moving across regions and subscriptions.  
- Some resources, like App Services, cannot be moved if a similar resource already exists in the target subscription.  
- Diagnostic tools can help debug issues when moving resources.  
- Locks affect operations as follows:  
  - **Read-only lock**: Cannot modify or move the resource out of the resource group.  
  - **Delete lock**: Cannot delete the resource but can move it out of the resource group.  
- You can move a resource **into** a resource group that has a read-only lock applied.  
- Moving a resource while an active deployment is ongoing in the resource group will cause the move to fail.  
- Locks must be removed before moving a resource out of a resource group if the lock is read-only.  
- Locks are applied at the resource group level and can be named (e.g., "Do not delete me", "Don't touch").  

**Examples**  
- Created two resource groups: "Federation of Planets" (East US) and "Klingon Empire" (West US).  
- Created a disk resource named "dilithium" in the Federation of Planets group and moved it to Klingon Empire group successfully.  
- Applied a read-only lock on the disk resource and attempted to resize it — operation failed due to lock.  
- Applied a delete lock and attempted to delete the disk — deletion failed due to lock.  
- Tried moving the disk resource out of the resource group with both locks applied — failed due to read-only lock.  
- Removed read-only lock, left delete lock, and successfully moved the resource out.  
- Created another resource group "Romulan Star Empire" with a read-only lock and successfully moved a new disk resource into it.  
- Noted that moving resources during active deployments causes move failure.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always check for resource locks before moving resources; read-only locks block moves out, delete locks block deletions only.  
- You can move resources into resource groups with read-only locks but cannot move them out without removing the lock.  
- Moving resources during active deployments in the resource group will fail — avoid concurrent deployments and moves.  
- Some resource types have specific limitations when moving across subscriptions or regions (e.g., App Services).  
- Use diagnostic tools to troubleshoot move failures.  
- Understand the difference between read-only and delete locks and their impact on resource management.  
- Locks are a critical feature to prevent accidental changes and deletions, especially in production environments.  
- Exam questions may test your knowledge of these lock behaviors and move limitations — memorize these scenarios.

### ARM CheatSheet

**Timestamp**: 02:06:40 – 02:08:58

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is a management layer for Azure resources.  
- ARM allows creation, updating, deletion of resources and management features like access controls, locks, and tags.  
- ARM supports infrastructure as code (IaC) through JSON templates (ARM templates).  
- ARM spans multiple Azure features: subscriptions, management groups, resource groups, resource providers, resource locks, blueprints, tags, IAM (role-based access control), policies, and templates.  
- ARM acts as a gatekeeper for all requests to Azure resources, deciding if requests are permitted.  
- Scope defines boundaries of control and governance for Azure resources, organized hierarchically: management groups > subscriptions > resource groups > resources.  
- Resource providers represent Azure services; some are registered by default, others require manual registration.  
- Resource tags are key-value pairs assigned to resources for organization.  
- Resource locks prevent accidental modification or deletion; two types exist: "CanNotDelete" and "ReadOnly".  
- Azure Blueprints enable quick creation of governed subscriptions and can deploy nearly everything achievable with ARM templates.  

**Definitions**  
- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**: The service layer that manages Azure resources by enabling creation, update, deletion, and management features like access control and tagging.  
- **Scope**: A boundary of control for Azure resources used to govern and apply rules logically across resources.  
- **Resource Providers**: Services within Azure that provide resources; some are pre-registered, others need explicit registration.

### ARM Template Skeleton

**Timestamp**: 02:11:53 – 02:13:15

**Key Concepts**  
- ARM templates are JSON files that define the infrastructure and configuration for Azure resources.  
- The general structure (skeleton) of an ARM template includes several key sections that organize the template’s content and behavior.  
- Each section in the template serves a specific purpose, from defining schema to specifying resources and outputs.

**Definitions**  
- **Schema**: Describes the JSON structure and properties expected within the ARM template. It links to a JSON schema URL that validates the template format.  
- **Content Version**: A user-defined version string for the template, used to track changes; it is arbitrary and does not affect deployment.  
- **API Profile**: A value used to avoid specifying API versions individually for each resource in the template.  
- **Parameters**: Input values passed into the template to customize deployments.  
- **Variables**: Expressions or transformations applied to parameters or resource properties to simplify template logic.  
- **Functions**: User-defined functions available within the template to perform operations or calculations.  
- **Resources**: The Azure resources (e.g., VMs, storage accounts) that the template will deploy or update.  
- **Outputs**: Values returned after deployment, useful for referencing deployed resource properties.

**Key Facts**  
- The ARM template skeleton consists of these main sections: schema, contentVersion, apiProfile, parameters, variables, functions, resources, and outputs.  
- The **type** attribute in a resource follows the format: `<resource provider>/<resource type>` (e.g., Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts).  
- The **apiVersion** attribute specifies the REST API version for the resource; each resource provider has its own API versions that must be referenced correctly.  
- Resource **name** can be dynamic, often set using variables.

**Examples**  
- Example resource type: Storage account (`Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts`).  
- Resource name example: Using a variable to dynamically assign the resource name.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the purpose and content of each ARM template section—especially schema, parameters, variables, resources, and outputs.  
- Remember that the contentVersion is a user-defined string for version tracking and does not impact deployment behavior.  
- Know that apiProfile helps simplify API version management but individual resource apiVersion attributes still need to be accurate.  
- Be familiar with the resource section attributes: type, apiVersion, and name, as these are critical for defining Azure resources correctly.  
- Use variables to make resource names and properties dynamic and reusable within templates.  
- Outputs are important for retrieving information post-deployment, useful in chained deployments or scripts.

### ARM Template Resources

**Timestamp**: 02:13:15 – 02:14:32

**Key Concepts**  
- ARM template resources define the Azure resources you want to deploy or update.  
- Each resource has specific attributes such as type, API version, name, location, and other resource-specific properties.  
- Parameters allow passing values into the template to make deployments dynamic.  
- Variables can be used to dynamically set resource names or other properties.  
- API version is specific to each resource provider and must be looked up individually.  
- Location specifies the Azure region where the resource will be deployed.  
- Properties vary depending on the resource type (e.g., storage account kind).

**Definitions**  
- **Resource**: An Azure entity (e.g., virtual machine, database, storage account) defined in the ARM template to be provisioned or updated.  
- **Type**: The resource provider and resource type identifier used in the template (e.g., Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts).  
- **API Version**: The REST API version used for the resource, specific to each resource provider.  
- **Name**: The identifier for the resource, which can be static or dynamically set using variables or parameters.  
- **Location**: The Azure region where the resource will be deployed.  
- **Parameters**: Inputs passed into the ARM template to customize deployments.  
- **Properties**: Resource-specific settings that vary based on the resource type.

**Key Facts**  
- API versions differ per resource provider and must be individually referenced.  
- Most resources require a location property specifying the deployment region.  
- Resource names can be dynamic by referencing variables or parameters.  
- Properties section varies widely depending on the resource type (e.g., storage account kind is a property for storage accounts).  
- Parameters require a type declaration (e.g., string).

**Examples**  
- Storage account resource example with:  
  - Type set to storage account resource provider format.  
  - API version specified for the storage account.  
  - Name set dynamically using a variable.  
  - Location property defined.  
  - Properties including the kind of storage account.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always specify the correct API version for each resource provider in your ARM templates.  
- Use parameters to pass dynamic values into your templates and declare their types explicitly.  
- Use variables to create dynamic resource names or properties.  
- Remember that location is a required property for most resources.  
- Understand that resource properties differ by resource type—know the key properties for common resources like storage accounts.  
- Review resource provider documentation to confirm API versions and required properties before deployment.

### ARM Template Parameters

**Timestamp**: 02:14:32 – 02:16:02

**Key Concepts**  
- Parameters in ARM templates allow passing variables into the template to customize deployments.  
- Parameters are defined at the top of the ARM template and referenced within resource definitions.  
- Parameters have types that define the kind of data they accept.  
- Additional constraints and metadata can be applied to parameters to control input and provide clarity.

**Definitions**  
- **Parameter**: A variable input to an ARM template that allows customization of resource deployment.  
- **Parameter Types**: Data types that parameters can have, including string, secure string, int, bool, object, secure object, and array.  
- **Default Value**: A fallback value used if no parameter value is provided during deployment.  
- **Allowed Values**: A predefined list of acceptable values for a parameter, restricting input to those values only.  
- **Min/Max Value**: Numeric constraints that limit the minimum and maximum allowed integer values for a parameter.  
- **Min/Max Length**: String constraints that specify the minimum and maximum number of characters allowed.  
- **Description**: A text explanation of the parameter’s purpose, useful for clarity when deploying via the portal.

**Key Facts**  
- Parameter types include: string, secure string, int, bool, object, secure object, array.  
- Default values are used if no input is provided for a parameter.  
- Allowed values restrict parameters to a specific set of inputs (defined as an array).  
- Min and max values apply to integer parameters to enforce numeric limits.  
- Min and max length apply to string parameters to enforce character count limits.  
- Descriptions help users understand the parameter’s role during deployment.

**Examples**  
- Example of setting a parameter type as string.  
- Using parameters within resources by referencing them in the ARM template.  
- None of the examples showed full parameter JSON syntax, but the concept of defining and referencing parameters was demonstrated.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always define the parameter type to ensure correct input validation.  
- Use default values to provide fallback options and avoid deployment failures.  
- Use allowed values to restrict inputs and prevent invalid configurations.  
- Apply min/max values and lengths to enforce input constraints and improve template robustness.  
- Include descriptive text for parameters to improve usability and clarity in the Azure portal.  
- Understanding parameters is critical for customizing ARM template deployments effectively.

### ARM Template Functions

**Timestamp**: 02:16:02 – 02:17:42

**Key Concepts**  
- ARM template functions allow transformations on ARM template variables and parameters.  
- Functions come in two types:  
  - **Template functions**: Built-in functions provided by ARM.  
  - **User-defined functions**: Custom functions created to extend functionality (not covered in detail).  
- Functions are identified by their name followed by parentheses containing arguments.  
- Functions cover various categories including arrays, comparisons, dates, deployments, logical operators, numerical operations, objects, resources, providers, and strings.  
- Parameters and variables themselves are accessed via functions.  
- Variables simplify templates by storing transformed values for reuse and can be nested within JSON objects.

**Definitions**  
- **Template functions**: Predefined functions in ARM templates used to manipulate and transform data.  
- **User-defined functions**: Custom functions created by users to add specific functionality beyond built-in functions.  
- **Variables**: Named values in ARM templates that store results of functions or expressions for reuse and simplification.

**Key Facts**  
- Functions use the syntax: `functionName(arguments)` (parentheses indicate a function).  
- Examples of function categories:  
  - Array functions: `array`, `concat`, `contains`, `createArray`, `empty`, `first`  
  - Comparison functions: `less`, `equals`, `lessOrEquals`, `greater`, `greaterOrEquals`  
  - Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `if`, `not`  
  - Numerical functions: `add`, `div`, `float`, `int`, `min`, `max`  
  - Object functions: `contains`, `empty`, `intersection`  
  - Resource functions: `extensionResourceId`  
  - Provider and reference functions: `providers`, `reference`  
  - String functions: `base64`, `concat`, `contains`  
- Parameters and variables are accessed via functions, highlighting their functional nature.

**Examples**  
- None explicitly shown in this section; only function names and categories were listed.  
- Mentioned example: `equals()` function syntax explained as `equals(argument1, argument2)`.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Recognize that ARM template functions are essential for transforming and manipulating template data.  
- Understand the two types of functions: built-in (template) and user-defined.  
- Remember the syntax pattern: function name followed by parentheses with arguments.  
- Be familiar with the broad categories of built-in functions and their general purposes.  
- Know that parameters and variables are accessed via functions, reinforcing their dynamic nature.  
- Variables help simplify templates by storing reusable transformed values and can be nested within JSON objects.  
- User-defined functions exist but are less critical for exam focus based on this content.

---

### ARM Template Variables

**Timestamp**: 02:17:42 – 02:18:44

**Key Concepts**  
- Variables simplify ARM templates by storing reusable values.  
- Variables transform parameters and resource properties using functions.  
- Variables help shorten resource definitions by avoiding repeated complex expressions.  
- Variables can be nested within JSON objects for structured and hierarchical data.  
- Accessing nested variables uses square bracket notation.

**Definitions**  
- **Variables**: Named values in ARM templates that hold expressions or transformed data, making templates easier to read and maintain.  
- **Nested Variables**: Variables defined as JSON objects containing other variables or values, allowing hierarchical organization.

**Key Facts**  
- Variables are defined under the `variables` section in an ARM template.  
- Variables can include function calls and expressions on the right-hand side.  
- Nested variables can be accessed using syntax like `variables('environmentSettings')['test']`.  
- Using variables reduces repetition and complexity in resource property definitions.

**Examples**  
- Defining a variable `storageName` by combining multiple functions into one reusable value.  
- Nested variable example: `variables('environmentSettings')['test']['instanceSizes']` accessing a parameter-defined nested object.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always use variables to simplify and shorten ARM template resource property expressions.  
- Understand how to define and access nested variables using square bracket notation.  
- Remember variables can hold complex expressions and function results, improving template maintainability.  
- Practice reading and writing nested variables to handle complex template scenarios efficiently.

---

### ARM Template Output

**Timestamp**: 02:18:44 – 02:19:36

**Key Concepts**  
- ARM template **outputs** are used to return values from deployed resources.  
- Outputs enable you to access resource properties pragmatically after deployment.  
- Outputs can be simple strings or complex expressions using variables and functions.  
- Outputs are useful for chaining ARM templates by passing values from one deployment to another.  
- You can retrieve output values using the Azure CLI after deployment.

**Definitions**  
- **Outputs**: Sections in an ARM template that return values from deployed resources, allowing those values to be used programmatically or passed to subsequent deployments.

**Key Facts**  
- Outputs can return resource properties such as resource IDs.  
- Output values can be accessed via CLI commands querying the deployment.  
- Outputs facilitate sequential deployment workflows by passing data between templates.

**Examples**  
- Outputting a resource ID as a string using a variable or functions inside the output value.  
- Using CLI to show deployment outputs, e.g., retrieving the resource ID from the deployment output.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember to define outputs in your ARM templates to expose important resource information after deployment.  
- Use outputs to chain multiple ARM templates together by passing necessary values forward.  
- Practice retrieving outputs via Azure CLI to verify deployment results and use outputs in automation scripts.  
- Outputs help automate infrastructure as code by enabling dynamic referencing of deployed resource properties.

### Launch an ARM Template

**Timestamp**: 02:19:36 – 02:30:12

**Key Concepts**  
- ARM Templates enable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Azure resources using JSON files.  
- Templates define resources and their configurations declaratively, allowing repeatable deployments.  
- ARM templates are deployed at the resource group or subscription level, specifically within resource group deployments.  
- Outputs from one deployment can be used as inputs for chaining subsequent deployments.  
- Parameters and variables in templates allow customization and reuse.  
- Deployment failures do not roll back partially created resources; manual cleanup is required.  
- Azure portal allows deploying custom ARM templates via the “Deploy a custom template” option.  
- Existing resources can be exported as ARM templates from resource groups for reuse or modification.  

**Definitions**  
- **ARM Template**: A JSON file that declaratively defines Azure resources and their configurations for automated deployment.  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual or interactive configuration.  
- **Parameters**: Inputs to ARM templates that allow customization of resource properties at deployment time.  
- **Variables**: Values defined within the template that can be static or derived using functions, used to simplify template management.  
- **Outputs**: Values returned by a deployment that can be used programmatically or passed to other templates.  

**Key Facts**  
- Default content version in ARM templates is typically "1.0.0.0".  
- Common VM sizes must be available in the target region; e.g., Standard D1 may not be available, Standard B1LS is a valid alternative.  
- Password parameters can be set as secure strings to hide input during deployment.  
- Deployment failures do not automatically roll back created resources; manual deletion of resources is necessary.  
- Exporting templates from existing resource groups can include multiple resources but may not capture all configurations.  

**Examples**  
- Deploying a virtual machine named "WARF" with parameters such as username "warf", password "Testing123456", Ubuntu OS version 14, and storage replication type LRS.  
- Initial deployment failed due to unavailable VM size (Standard D1) in the region; corrected to Standard B1LS.  
- Partial resources like virtual network, storage account, and network interface were created despite deployment failure.  
- Exporting templates from resource groups to capture existing resource configurations for reuse.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand that ARM templates are declarative JSON files used to automate Azure resource deployments.  
- Know how to deploy ARM templates via the Azure portal using the “Deploy a custom template” option.  
- Always verify VM sizes and other resource properties are available in the target region to avoid deployment failures.  
- Remember that deployment failures do not roll back created resources; manual cleanup is required.

### ARM Template CheatSheet

**Timestamp**: 02:30:12 – 02:32:04

**Key Concepts**  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is managing and provisioning data centers via machine-readable definition files instead of manual or interactive configuration.  
- IaC has two approaches:  
  - Declarative: Define exactly what you want and get exactly that.  
  - Imperative: Specify generally what you want; system fills in the blanks.  
- ARM templates are JSON files used for declarative IaC in Azure.  
- ARM templates define Azure resources and configurations exactly as specified.  

**Definitions**  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable files rather than manual setup.  
- **Declarative IaC**: Defining the desired state explicitly; the system ensures the environment matches this state.  
- **Imperative IaC**: Defining steps or commands to achieve a desired state, often leaving some details to the system.  
- **ARM Template**: A JSON file that declaratively defines Azure resources and their configurations for deployment.  

**Key Facts**  
- ARM templates use a JSON structure with key sections:  
  - **$schema**: Describes available properties in the template.  
  - **contentVersion**: Version of the template; any value can be used.  
  - **apiProfile**: Optional; simplifies specifying API versions for resources.  
  - **parameters**: Inputs passed into the template to customize deployment.  
  - **variables**: Used to transform parameters or resource properties using functions and expressions.  
  - **functions**: Predefined functions available within templates (too many to list).  
  - **resources**: Defines Azure resources to deploy/update, including:  
    - type  
    - apiVersion  
    - name  
    - location  
    - properties (varies widely by resource)  
  - **outputs**: Values returned after deployment for further use.  

**Examples**  
- None specifically mentioned; focus was on the structure and components of ARM templates.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Know the JSON structure of ARM templates and the purpose of each section.  
- Understand the difference between declarative and imperative IaC, with ARM templates being declarative.  
- Be familiar with key template elements: schema, contentVersion, parameters, variables, resources, and outputs.  
- Remember that resource properties vary widely and are resource-specific.  
- Outputs can be used to retrieve values post-deployment for further automation or referencing.  
- API profile can simplify version management but is optional.  
- Functions and variables allow dynamic and reusable template logic but are complex and numerous—focus on practical usage rather than memorizing all functions.

### Core Storage Services

**Timestamp**: 02:35:49 – 02:37:43

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure provides five core storage services under storage accounts.  
- Different storage services serve different purposes: object storage, file sharing, messaging, and block storage.  
- Storage accounts are used to launch most storage services except Azure Disks, which are launched separately.  

**Definitions**  
- **Azure Blob Storage**: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data; supports big data analytics via Data Lake Storage Gen2. Files are treated as objects without needing to manage a file system.  
- **Azure Files**: A managed file share service that allows multiple virtual machines to share the same file system and files.  
- **Azure Queues**: A NoSQL store for schema-less structured data, used for messaging between application components (categorized under storage but functions as messaging).  
- **Azure Disk Storage**: Block-level storage volumes specifically for Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). Disks are launched separately from storage accounts.  

**Key Facts**  
- Azure Blob Storage supports big data analytics through Data Lake Storage Gen2.  
- Azure Files enables shared file systems across multiple VMs.  
- Azure Queues provide reliable messaging but are categorized under storage accounts.  
- Azure Disks are block-level storage volumes for VMs and are managed separately from the other four core storage services.  
- Some storage accounts (like general-purpose v2) may be involved in disk backup or storage, but disks themselves are launched independently.  

**Examples**  
- Using Azure Files to share the same file system among multiple virtual machines.  
- Azure Blob Storage for uploading files as objects without managing file systems.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember the five core storage services: Blob, Files, Queues, (Messaging), and Disks.  
- Blob storage is ideal for scalable object storage and big data analytics.  
- Azure Files is best when multiple VMs need shared access to the same files.  
- Azure Queues, though under storage accounts, function as a messaging service for application components.  
- Azure Disks are block storage volumes for VMs and are managed separately from storage accounts.  
- For exam purposes, know the purpose and basic use case of each core storage service.

### Performance Tiers

**Timestamp**: 02:37:43 – 02:39:51

**Key Concepts**  
- Performance tiers apply primarily to Azure Blob storage accounts.  
- Two main performance tiers: **Standard** and **Premium**.  
- Performance is measured in IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second).  
- Premium tier uses SSDs (Solid-State Drives) optimized for low latency and higher throughput.  
- Standard tier uses HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) with varied performance depending on access tier.

**Definitions**  
- **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)**: A measure of how many read/write operations a storage device can perform per second; higher IOPS means faster performance.  
- **Premium Performance Tier**: Storage backed by SSDs, offering higher IOPS, low latency, and higher throughput.  
- **Standard Performance Tier**: Storage backed by HDDs, with performance varying by access tier (hot, cool, archive).

**Key Facts**  
- Premium tier SSDs have no moving parts, enabling faster random read/write operations.  
- Standard tier HDDs have moving parts (an ARM) and perform best with sequential read/write operations.  
- SSDs are suited for interactive workloads, analytics, AI/ML, and data transformation.  
- HDDs are suited for backup, disaster recovery, media content, and bulk data processing.  
- Neither SSD nor HDD is inherently better; choice depends on workload needs and cost considerations.

**Examples**  
- Premium SSDs used for AI/ML workloads and interactive analytics.  
- Standard HDDs used for backup and disaster recovery scenarios.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember the two performance tiers: Standard (HDD) vs. Premium (SSD).  
- Higher IOPS = better performance; premium tier provides this via SSDs.  
- Choose performance tier based on workload type and cost: SSDs for speed-critical tasks, HDDs for cost-effective bulk storage.  
- Understand that HDDs excel at sequential data access, SSDs excel at random access with low latency.  
- Performance tier selection impacts latency, throughput, and cost—know these trade-offs for exam scenarios.

### Access Tiers

**Timestamp**: 02:39:51 – 02:43:37

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure Storage offers three access tiers for standard storage: Hot, Cool, and Archive.  
- Access tiers help optimize storage costs based on how frequently data is accessed.  
- Tiering can be applied at the storage account level or at the individual BLOB level.  
- Moving data between tiers can incur different costs and sometimes delays (rehydration).  
- Lifecycle management policies can automate moving data between tiers based on rules.

**Definitions**  
- **Hot Tier**: For data accessed frequently; highest storage cost but lowest access cost. Suitable for active data or data staged for processing.  
- **Cool Tier**: For infrequently accessed data stored for at least 30 days; lower storage cost than Hot but higher access cost. Used for short-term backup, disaster recovery, or older media content.  
- **Archive Tier**: For rarely accessed data stored for at least 180 days; lowest storage cost but highest access cost. Intended for long-term backup, archival, compliance data, or original raw data preservation.  
- **Rehydration**: The process of moving a BLOB out of the Archive tier to a hotter tier, which can take several hours.  
- **BLOB Lifecycle Management**: Rule-based policies to automatically transition BLOBs between tiers or delete them based on age or other criteria.

**Key Facts**  
- Cool tier requires data to be stored for a minimum of 30 days.  
- Archive tier requires data to be stored for a minimum of 180 days.  
- Not all replication types support the Archive tier; configuration may affect tier availability.  
- Changing tiers is instant except when moving out of Archive (rehydration delay).  
- When moving a BLOB to a cooler tier, the operation is billed as a write operation at the destination tier rates.  
- When moving a BLOB to a hotter tier, the operation is billed as a read operation at the source tier rates.  
- Early deletion charges apply if data is moved out of Cool or Archive tiers before the minimum storage duration (30 days for Cool, 180 days for Archive). Charges are prorated.  
- If a BLOB does not have an explicitly assigned tier, it inherits the tier from the storage account’s default access tier.

**Examples**  
- Cool tier use cases: short-term backup, disaster recovery data sets, older media content not frequently viewed but expected to be available immediately, large data sets stored cost-effectively while gathering more data.  
- Archive tier use cases: long-term backup, secondary backup, archival data sets, original raw data preservation, compliance data rarely accessed.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember the minimum storage durations: 30 days for Cool, 180 days for Archive to avoid early deletion charges.  
- Understand cost implications: Hot tier has highest storage cost but lowest access cost; Archive has lowest storage cost but highest access cost.  
- Know that rehydration from Archive can take hours—plan accordingly for data retrieval.  
- Use lifecycle management policies to automate cost optimization by moving data between tiers based on usage patterns.  
- Be aware that some replication settings may disable the Archive tier option.  
- Tier changes are immediate except for Archive to other tiers, which require rehydration.  
- Charges for tier changes depend on the direction of the move (write vs read operations).

### Replication Data Redundancy

**Timestamp**: 02:43:37 – 02:45:30

**Key Concepts**  
- Replication is used to create multiple copies of data to protect against outages, hardware failures, network/power issues, and natural disasters.  
- Different replication types offer varying levels of redundancy and cost.  
- Replication types are categorized into three main groups based on redundancy scope and access:  
  1. Primary region redundancy  
  2. Secondary region redundancy  
  3. Secondary region redundancy with read access  

**Definitions**  
- **Replication**: The process of copying data multiple times across different locations or zones to ensure durability and availability.  
- **Local Redundant Storage (LRS)**: Replicates data synchronously three times within a single primary region; most cost-effective.  
- **Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS)**: Replicates data across multiple availability zones within the primary region.  
- **Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)**: Replicates data to a secondary geographic region for higher redundancy.  
- **Geo-Zone Redundant Storage (GZRS)**: Combines geo-redundancy with zone redundancy.  
- **Read Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RAGRS)**: Provides read access to the secondary region’s replicated data.  
- **Read Access Geo-Zone Redundant Storage (RAGZRS)**: Read access with geo-zone redundancy.

**Key Facts**  
- LRS and ZRS fall under primary region redundancy.  
- GRS and GZRS fall under secondary region redundancy.  
- RAGRS and RAGZRS provide read access to replicated data in the secondary region.  
- LRS is typically used for development accounts due to its cost-effectiveness.  
- Data in primary region redundancy is replicated at least three times within the primary region.  
- LRS uses synchronous replication within the region.

**Examples**  
- Using LRS for development accounts as a cost-effective replication choice.  
- No other specific practical examples mentioned.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the three categories of replication redundancy and their use cases.  
- Remember the acronyms and what they stand for, focusing on LRS, ZRS, GRS, GZRS, RAGRS, and RAGZRS.  
- Know that higher redundancy levels come with higher costs.  
- LRS replicates data three times synchronously within the primary region and is the most cost-effective option.  
- Secondary region redundancy options provide disaster recovery across geographic regions.  
- Read access redundancy options allow reading from the secondary region replica, useful for read-heavy workloads or failover scenarios.

### LRS ZRS

**Timestamp**: 02:45:30 – 02:47:01

**Key Concepts**  
- Primary region redundancy options for Azure Storage replication  
- Differences between LRS (Locally Redundant Storage) and ZRS (Zone-Redundant Storage)  
- Synchronous replication within the primary region  
- Durability levels associated with LRS and ZRS  
- Impact of availability zone failures on data availability  

**Definitions**  
- **LRS (Locally Redundant Storage)**: Replicates data synchronously three times within a single availability zone in the primary region.  
- **ZRS (Zone-Redundant Storage)**: Replicates data synchronously across three different availability zones within the primary region.  

**Key Facts**  
- LRS uses synchronous replication to maintain three copies of data within one availability zone.  
- ZRS uses synchronous replication to maintain three copies of data across three separate availability zones.  
- Durability for LRS is 11 nines (99.999999999%).  
- Durability for ZRS is 12 nines (99.9999999999%), making it more durable than LRS.  
- LRS is the cheapest storage option and suitable for developer accounts or scenarios where replication is not critical.  
- ZRS provides higher availability by protecting against an entire availability zone failure within the primary region.  
- If an availability zone fails, data in LRS is lost; in ZRS, data remains available in other zones.  

**Examples**  
- Choosing LRS for developer accounts where replication durability is less critical.  
- Choosing ZRS when you need higher durability and protection against availability zone outages.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember that both LRS and ZRS replicate data synchronously within the primary region but differ in the scope of replication (single zone vs multiple zones).  
- ZRS offers better durability and availability than LRS by spanning multiple availability zones.  
- LRS is the most cost-effective option but has lower fault tolerance.  
- Understand the difference in durability levels (11 nines vs 12 nines) as a measure of reliability.  
- For exam scenarios involving availability zone failures, ZRS is the preferred choice over LRS.

### GRS GZRS

**Timestamp**: 02:47:01 – 02:49:02

**Key Concepts**  
- Secondary region redundancy protects against regional disasters by replicating data to a paired secondary region.  
- Secondary regions are paired automatically; users cannot choose the pair.  
- Secondary regions are normally on standby and not available for read/write access except during failover.  
- GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage) and GZRS (Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage) combine synchronous replication within the primary region and asynchronous replication to the secondary region.  
- Synchronous replication guarantees data consistency within the primary region.  
- Asynchronous replication to the secondary region means data may not be fully up-to-date or consistent at any given moment.  
- GZRS adds zone-redundancy within the primary region by replicating data asynchronously across three availability zones before geo-replication.  
- Durability for GRS is extremely high (16 nines).  
- Read-access geo-redundant options (RAGRS, RAGZRS) provide synchronous replication to the secondary region to enable consistent read replicas.

**Definitions**  
- **Secondary Region Redundancy**: Replication of data to a geographically paired region to protect against regional outages or disasters.  
- **Paired Region**: A fixed secondary region automatically assigned to a primary region for geo-replication purposes.  
- **Synchronous Replication**: Data is copied in real-time ensuring consistency and durability guarantees.  
- **Asynchronous Replication**: Data is copied with a delay, so the secondary copy may lag behind the primary.  
- **GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage)**: Storage replication strategy that synchronously replicates data within the primary region and asynchronously replicates to a paired secondary region.  
- **GZRS (Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage)**: Similar to GRS but adds asynchronous replication across three availability zones within the primary region before geo-replication.  
- **RAGRS / RAGZRS**: Read-access geo-redundant storage options that provide synchronous replication to the secondary region, enabling read access to the secondary copy.

**Key Facts**  
- Secondary regions are not available for read/write access unless failover occurs (except for RAGRS/RAGZRS).  
- GRS durability is 16 nines (99.99999999999999%).  
- Data in the secondary region is asynchronously copied, so it may not be fully up-to-date.  
- GZRS replicates data asynchronously across 3 availability zones in the primary region before geo-replication.  
- The secondary region in GZRS may not replicate data across multiple AZs (based on the graphic referenced).  
- RAGRS and RAGZRS provide synchronous replication to the secondary region to ensure data consistency for read replicas.

**Examples**  
- None explicitly mentioned beyond conceptual descriptions of replication behavior.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the difference between synchronous (within primary region) and asynchronous (to secondary region) replication in GRS and GZRS.  
- Remember that secondary regions are paired and cannot be chosen by the user.  
- Know that GRS/GZRS provide geo-redundancy but secondary copies are not readable unless failover occurs.  
- RAGRS/RAGZRS enable read access to the secondary region by using synchronous replication across regions.  
- GZRS adds zone redundancy within the primary region, improving durability before geo-replication.  
- Durability of GRS is extremely high (16 nines), making it suitable for critical data requiring geo-redundancy.

- Synchronous data replication between primary and secondary regions for read replicas  
- Ensuring data consistency (one-to-one sync) between primary and secondary regions for read operations  

**Definitions**  
- **RAGRS / RAGZRS**: Storage options that provide read access to a secondary region with synchronous data replication to maintain data consistency between primary and secondary regions.  

**Key Facts**  
- Data is synchronous in both primary and secondary regions when using RAGRS or RAGZRS  
- The purpose of these options is to enable a read replica in another region with data in sync  
- This differs from asynchronous replication where data may lag or be out of sync  

**Examples**  
- None mentioned explicitly, but the concept described is having a read replica in a secondary region with synchronous data replication  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember that RAGRS and RAGZRS provide synchronous replication to the secondary region to support read replicas  
- Synchronous replication ensures data consistency for read operations across regions  
- This is critical when you want to read from a geographically distant region without risking stale data  
- Understand the difference between asynchronous replication (used in other redundancy options) and synchronous replication in RAGRS/RAGZRS

- SAS provides a way to authorize access besides using Active Directory.  
- There are different types of SAS depending on the scope and authentication method.  
- SAS tokens can be created as ad hoc or with stored access policies.  
- SAS URIs include query parameters that define permissions, start and expiry times, resource types, and authentication signatures.

**Definitions**  
- **Shared Access Signature (SAS)**: A URI that grants restricted access rights to Azure storage resources for a limited time and with specific permissions.  
- **Account-level SAS**: Grants access to resources across one or more storage services within a storage account.  
- **Service-level SAS**: Grants access to a single storage service using storage account keys.  
- **User Delegated SAS**: Uses Azure AD credentials to access storage accounts, limited to Blob and container resources; considered best practice by Microsoft.  
- **Ad hoc SAS**: SAS token with start time, expiry time, and permissions embedded directly in the URI.  
- **Service SAS with Stored Access Policy**: SAS token linked to a stored access policy defined on a resource container, allowing management of constraints across multiple SAS tokens.

**Key Facts**  
- SAS types: Account-level, Service-level, User Delegated.  
- User Delegated SAS is limited to Blob and container resources only.  
- Stored access policies apply to Blob, container, table, queue, and file share resources (disks are excluded).  
- SAS URI components include:  
  - `sv`: Storage service version  
  - `st`: Start time  
  - `se`: Expiry time  
  - `sr`: Storage resource type (e.g., B for Blob, Q for Queue)  
  - `sp`: Permissions (e.g., read, write)  
  - `sig`: Signature used for authentication (SHA-256)  
- SAS tokens can be easily generated via the Azure Portal under the storage account’s Shared Access Signature section.

**Examples**  
- Example URI structure discussed:  
  - Storage account URL + container + file name + query string parameters (sv, st, se, sr, sp, sig)  
- Generating SAS token: Open Azure Portal → Storage Account → Shared Access Signature → select options → generate URI → use URI for access.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the different SAS types and when to use each (account, service, user delegated).  
- User Delegated SAS with Azure AD is the recommended best practice for Blob storage access.  
- Know the difference between ad hoc SAS and SAS with stored access policies.  
- Be familiar with the key query parameters in a SAS URI and what they represent.

**Key Concepts**  
- AZCopy is a command-line tool used to efficiently copy files to and from Azure Storage Accounts.  
- You can use AZCopy via Cloud Shell for a consistent cross-platform experience (Linux, Mac, Windows).  
- Authentication with AZCopy can be done using either:  
  - Azure AD login (`azcopy login`)  
  - Shared Access Signature (SAS) tokens appended to URLs  
- Storage accounts contain containers, which hold blobs (files). Containers can be private or public.  
- Proper role assignments are required to upload/download blobs using AZCopy (e.g., Storage Blob Data Owner or Contributor).  
- SAS tokens provide granular, time-limited access to storage resources without sharing account keys.  

**Definitions**  
- **AZCopy**: A command-line utility designed to copy data to/from Azure Storage accounts quickly and securely.  
- **Shared Access Signature (SAS)**: A URI that grants restricted access rights to Azure Storage resources without exposing account keys.  
- **Container**: A logical grouping within a storage account that holds blobs (files).  
- **Blob**: A file stored in Azure Blob Storage.  
- **Storage Blob Data Owner/Contributor**: Azure roles that grant permissions to manage blobs within storage accounts.  

**Key Facts**  
- AZCopy can be downloaded for multiple platforms: Windows, Linux, Mac.  
- When using Cloud Shell, files can be uploaded to the mounted storage share for use with AZCopy.  
- To extract the AZCopy binary from a tarball in Cloud Shell, use: `tar -xvzf <filename>.tar.gz`  
- The AZCopy executable may require execution permissions (`chmod u+x azcopy`).  
- To authenticate with Azure AD via AZCopy, run `azcopy login` and complete the browser sign-in with a provided code.  
- Blob URLs follow the format:  
  `https://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>/<blob-name>`  
- Role assignments for blob access must be done via Access Control (IAM) in the Azure portal; changes can take ~5 minutes to propagate.  
- SAS tokens start with a question mark (`?`) and are appended to blob/container URLs to grant access.  
- Common SAS permissions include read, write, add, create, and list.  
- SAS tokens can be generated in the Azure portal under the storage account’s Shared Access Signature settings.  
- Sometimes AZCopy in Cloud Shell may have issues with SAS authentication; using a local AZCopy client (e.g., Windows version) can resolve this.  

**Examples**  
- Created a storage account named **Fajo** with a container named **Kivas Fagio** (private access).  
- Uploaded an image file (`Kivas Fagio.jpg`) to the container using AZCopy with Azure AD login authentication.  
- Generated a SAS token with permissions for Blob storage (read, write, add, create) and attempted to upload using SAS appended to the URL.  
- Encountered a 403 error initially due to missing role assignment; resolved by assigning Storage Blob Data Contributor role to the user.  
- Demonstrated troubleshooting steps when SAS upload failed in Cloud Shell but succeeded using Windows AZCopy client.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always ensure you have the correct role assignments (Storage Blob Data Owner or Contributor) to perform blob operations with AZCopy.  
- Use `azcopy login` for Azure AD authentication or SAS tokens appended to URLs for delegated access.  
- Blob URLs must be correctly formatted: `https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<blob>`  
- SAS tokens must start with a question mark (`?`) when appended to URLs.  
- When using Cloud Shell, upload your files and AZCopy binaries to the mounted storage share before running commands.  
- If AZCopy commands fail in Cloud Shell, try using a local AZCopy client as a fallback.  
- Role assignment changes may take several minutes to take effect—be patient before retrying operations.  
- Practice generating SAS tokens with appropriate permissions and understand their scope and expiry.  
- Remember to clean up resources (delete resource groups) after practice to avoid unnecessary charges.

### Create a File Share with Files

**Timestamp**: 03:26:14 – 03:37:22

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure File Share is a sub-service within a Storage Account, not a standalone service.  
- File shares can be created under General Purpose v2 or Premium storage accounts.  
- Premium storage accounts can be dedicated to file storage only (FileStorage account kind).  
- Azure Files supports SMB protocol for mounting shares to virtual machines.  
- Mounting Azure File Shares on Linux requires installing `cifs-utils`.  
- Port 445 (TCP) must be opened on the VM’s network security group for SMB communication.  
- Credentials for mounting are stored securely in a file with restricted permissions.  
- Azure File Shares support soft delete (default 7 days) and can be configured for large file shares (up to 100 TB).  
- File operations on the mounted share reflect immediately on the Azure File Share.  

**Definitions**  
- **Azure File Share**: A managed file share service within Azure Storage Accounts that can be mounted via SMB protocol to VMs.  
- **General Purpose v2 Storage Account**: A multi-purpose storage account that supports blobs, files, queues, and tables.  
- **Premium FileStorage Account**: A storage account dedicated solely to file shares, optimized for premium performance.  
- **SMB (Server Message Block)**: A network file sharing protocol used to mount Azure File Shares.  
- **cifs-utils**: A Linux utility package required to mount SMB file shares.  

**Key Facts**

- Default file share capacity example used: 3 GB (small for demo purposes).  
- VM size chosen for demo: B1LS (cost-effective, approx. $6/month).  
- Linux VM image used: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Generation 2.  
- SMB communicates over TCP port 445, which must be explicitly opened in the VM’s network security group.  
- Soft delete for Azure File Shares is enabled by default for 7 days.  
- Mounting requires creating a mount directory and a credentials file with restricted permissions (`chmod 600`).  

**Examples**  
- Created a resource group and storage account named "KeyVoss".  
- Created a file share named "Kivas" with 3 GB quota.  
- Launched an Ubuntu Linux VM named "Kivas" to mount the file share.  
- Opened port 445 on the VM’s network security group for SMB.  
- Installed `cifs-utils` on the Linux VM (`sudo apt update && sudo apt install cifs-utils`).  
- Created directories `/mnt/kivas` and `/etc/smbcredentials` on the VM.  
- Created a credentials file with Azure Storage account username and key, set permissions to 600.  
- Mounted the Azure File Share using the CIFS protocol with the credentials file.  
- Uploaded an image file ("Kivas Faggio") via the Azure Portal upload button to the file share.  
- Verified file presence and demonstrated file operations (move, delete) reflecting immediately on the mounted share.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always create Azure File Shares inside a Storage Account (General Purpose v2 or Premium FileStorage).  
- Remember to open TCP port 445 on the VM’s NSG to allow SMB traffic.  
- On Linux VMs, install `cifs-utils` to enable mounting SMB shares.  
- Use a credentials file with restricted permissions to securely store storage account keys for mounting.  
- Azure File Shares support soft delete and large file shares (up to 100 TB) but large file shares must be enabled explicitly.  
- File operations on the mounted share are immediately reflected in Azure Files and vice versa.  
- For file sync scenarios, Windows VMs are required (Linux mounting is for direct file share access only).  
- Use cost-effective VM sizes (e.g., B1LS) for demo or lab environments.  
- When copying multi-line commands in Cloud Shell or SSH, paste line-by-line to avoid errors.

### Setup Files Sync

**Timestamp**: 03:37:22 – 03:54:31

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure File Sync extends Azure File Shares by enabling synchronization between on-premises Windows Servers (or Azure VMs) and Azure Files in the cloud.  
- Requires a Windows Server VM to install the Azure File Sync Agent (cannot be done from Linux).  
- Setup involves creating a Storage Account, a File Share, a Storage Sync Service, and launching a Windows Server VM.  
- Registration of the Windows Server VM with the Storage Sync Service is necessary via the Azure File Sync Agent.  
- Sync Groups are created to manage synchronization between cloud endpoints (Azure File Shares) and server endpoints (folders on Windows Server).  
- Cloud tiering can be enabled to optimize local disk space by keeping frequently accessed files locally and tiering others to the cloud.  
- Proper cleanup requires deleting server endpoints, cloud endpoints, sync groups, and then the storage sync service before deleting the resource group.

**Definitions**  
- **Azure File Sync**: A service that centralizes file shares in Azure Files while keeping the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server. It synchronizes files between Windows Servers and Azure File Shares.  
- **Storage Sync Service**: The Azure resource that orchestrates file synchronization between cloud and server endpoints.  
- **Sync Group**: A grouping of cloud endpoints and server endpoints that are kept in sync.  
- **Cloud Endpoint**: The Azure File Share in the cloud that is part of a sync group.  
- **Server Endpoint**: A folder on a registered Windows Server that syncs with the cloud endpoint.  
- **Cloud Tiering**: A feature that preserves a specified percentage of free space on the server volume by tiering infrequently accessed files to Azure Files.

**Key Facts**  
- Windows Server 2019 (Generation 2) was used for the VM in the example.  
- Minimum VM size requires at least 2 vCPUs (e.g., DSV3 or D2 v2).  
- File Share size example: 5 GB (small size sufficient for demo).  
- Ports to open on VM: at least port 3389 (RDP) plus any others needed.  
- Azure File Sync Agent installation requires PowerShell module AzureRM and disabling IE Enhanced Security Configuration temporarily for easier download.  
- Cloud tiering example: preserve 20% free space on the volume.  
- Deletion order for cleanup: delete server endpoints → delete cloud endpoints → delete sync group → delete storage sync service → delete resource group.

**Examples**  
- Creating a Windows Server VM named "Kivas" with Windows Server 2019 for Azure File Sync.  
- Creating a Storage Account and a 5 GB file share named "Kivas".  
- Installing AzureRM PowerShell module and Azure File Sync Agent on the Windows VM.  
- Registering the VM with the Storage Sync Service using Azure File Sync Agent.  
- Creating a folder `C:\kivas` on the VM, adding a test file `hello.txt`, and sharing it.

### Windows Vs Linux

**Timestamp**: 04:23:57 – 04:26:34

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure supports running both Windows and Linux virtual machines (VMs).  
- Windows VMs require a license to run but launching without one results in an unactivated state, not immediate charges.  
- Windows VMs typically require larger instance sizes due to running a full desktop environment.  
- Linux VMs generally do not require licenses (except some distributions like Red Hat if support is needed).  
- Linux VMs can run on smaller instance sizes since they usually operate in a terminal-based environment without a full desktop.  
- Access methods differ: Windows uses RDP with username/password; Linux uses SSH with username/password or SSH key pairs.  
- Update management can automate OS patching for both Windows and Linux VMs across Azure, on-premises, and other clouds.

**Definitions**  
- **Hybrid License**: A licensing option where enterprises bring their own existing Windows licenses to Azure VMs instead of using Azure-provided licenses.  
- **Update Management**: A service that automates the installation of operating system updates and patches on virtual machines regardless of their location.

**Key Facts**  
- Windows Server requires a license but launching without one only shows "Windows is unactivated" and requires manual activation.  
- Windows VMs need larger instance types (e.g., B2) compared to Linux VMs (e.g., B1) due to the full desktop environment.  
- Linux VMs typically do not have licensing fees unless using enterprise distributions like Red Hat with support.  
- Windows VMs are accessed via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) using username and password.  
- Linux VMs are accessed via SSH using username/password or SSH private key (.pem file).  
- Update management supports patching for both Windows and Linux VMs on Azure, on-premises, and other cloud providers.

**Examples**  
- Windows VM requires a B2 instance size (larger and more expensive) because it runs a full desktop environment.  
- Linux VM can run on smaller instance sizes like B1 since it is terminal-based and does not run a full desktop environment.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Do not worry about immediate licensing fees when launching Windows VMs; manual activation is required later.  
- Use SSH private keys for Linux VM access for better security; Windows VMs require username/password for RDP.  
- Linux VMs are generally more cost-effective for learning and certification purposes due to smaller instance requirements and no licensing fees.  
- Understand the difference in access methods and resource requirements between Windows and Linux VMs.  
- Use update management to automate patching and updates across both Windows and Linux environments, including hybrid and multi-cloud setups.

### VM Monitoring

**Timestamp**: 04:53:15 – 05:27:55

**Key Concepts**  
- Monitoring Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) involves checking performance and diagnostics.  
- Important Azure services for VM monitoring: Automation Accounts, Log Analytics, Metrics, and Alerts.  
- Resource providers for alerts management and insights must be registered/enabled in the subscription.  
- Guest OS diagnostics/metrics require the Azure Monitoring Agent (WAG agent) installed on the VM.  
- Log Analytics Workspace acts as a centralized data lake for collecting and querying logs from multiple resources.  
- Automation Accounts manage configuration and update management for VMs, including patching and running automated scripts (runbooks).  
- Diagnostic settings enable collection of guest metrics such as memory, disk, network, and CPU usage.  
- Host metrics are collected by default (CPU, etc.), but guest metrics (memory, disk space) require explicit enabling.  
- Alerts can be created based on log queries or metric thresholds to notify on VM health or performance issues.  
- Performance counters on Windows VMs must be enabled to send guest metrics.  
- Stress testing tools (e.g., StressNG on Linux) can be used to generate load and test monitoring data collection.  
- Azure Monitor Logs use Kusto Query Language (KQL) for querying collected data.  

**Definitions**  
- **Automation Account**: Azure service for managing VM configurations, updates, and running automated tasks (runbooks).  
- **Log Analytics Workspace**: A centralized repository (data lake) for collecting, storing, and querying logs and metrics from Azure resources.  
- **Guest Metrics**: Performance and diagnostic data collected from inside the VM OS (memory usage, disk space, network stats).  
- **Host Metrics**: Performance data collected from the VM host infrastructure (CPU usage, basic metrics).  
- **Runbook**: A set of automated tasks or scripts executed via Azure Automation to manage VMs or other resources.  
- **WAG Agent (Windows Azure Guest Agent)**: Agent installed on VMs to enable diagnostics and monitoring data collection.  
- **Diagnostic Settings**: Configuration on a VM to send guest metrics and logs to Azure Monitor or storage accounts.  
- **Heartbeat**: A periodic signal sent by a VM to indicate it is alive and responsive.  

**Key Facts**  
- Resource providers to enable:  
  - `alertsmanagement` (for alerts)  
  - `insights` (for monitoring and diagnostics)  
- Minimal Linux installs may lack the WAG agent, preventing guest metrics collection unless manually installed.  
- Windows Server VMs require at least DS2v2 or DS2v3 size for proper monitoring support (due to CPU/memory requirements).  
- Diagnostic data is stored in Azure Storage accounts created automatically or manually linked.  
- Automation Accounts require an Azure Run As Account with contributor permissions to manage resources.  
- Log Analytics workspace can be created manually or via Automation Account setup for better integration.  
- Performance counters on Windows need to be started manually to begin sending guest metrics.  
- Guest metrics include memory, network, disk, and storage usage; these are not collected by default.  
- Alerts can be created based on log queries with customizable thresholds and incur monthly costs.  
- Azure Monitor Logs use Kusto Query Language (KQL) for querying logs and metrics.  
- VM monitoring data may take some time to appear after enabling diagnostics and generating load.  
- StressNG is a Linux tool used to simulate high memory usage for testing monitoring setups.  

**Examples**  
- Created three VMs for demonstration:  
  - Ubuntu minimal install (no guest metrics agent by default)  
  - Ubuntu LTS with guest metrics enabled (WAG agent installed)  
  - Windows Server VM (DS2v3 size, guest metrics enabled, performance counters started manually)  
- Installed StressNG on Ubuntu VM to generate 90% memory usage to produce monitoring data.  
- Created Automation Account named "DAX Automation" linked to resource group "DAX" for update management and runbooks.  
- Created Log Analytics workspace manually and linked VMs to it for centralized log collection.  
- Ran sample Kusto queries in Log Analytics to check VM availability via heartbeat logs.  
- Created alert rules based on log queries with threshold values.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always ensure the required resource providers (`alertsmanagement` and `insights`) are registered before enabling monitoring features.  
- Guest OS diagnostics require the Azure Monitoring Agent (WAG agent); minimal Linux installs may need manual installation.  
- Use Automation Accounts for patch management and running automated scripts on VMs.  
- Create and link a Log Analytics workspace to collect and query VM logs and metrics effectively.  
- Enable diagnostic settings on VMs to collect guest metrics like memory and disk usage, which are not collected by default.  
- On Windows VMs, start performance counters manually to enable guest metrics collection.  
- Use tools like StressNG to generate load and verify monitoring data collection during exams or practicals.  
- Familiarize yourself with Kusto Query Language (KQL) for querying Azure Monitor Logs.  
- Alerts can be configured based on log queries or metrics to proactively monitor VM health and performance.  
- Be aware that monitoring data may take time to appear after setup; patience is required during troubleshooting.  
- Always clean up resources (resource groups) after practice to avoid unnecessary costs.

### Disk Roles

**Timestamp**: 05:34:01 – 05:35:42

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure virtual machines use three types of disk roles: Data disk, OS disk, and Temporary disk.  
- Each disk role serves a specific purpose related to storage and VM operation.  
- These disks can be viewed in Windows Disk Management when connected to a VM.  

**Definitions**  
- **Data Disk**: A managed disk attached to a VM for storing application and user data. Registered as an SCSI drive and labeled with a drive letter.  
- **OS Disk**: The operating system disk attached to every VM containing the boot volume and pre-installed OS selected during VM creation.  
- **Temporary Disk**: A non-managed disk providing short-term storage for temporary data like page or swap files. Data may be lost during maintenance or redeployment but persists through standard reboots.  

**Key Facts**  
- Data disks:  
  - Maximum capacity of 32 GB (note: this may be a transcript error or outdated; typically data disks can be larger, but only what was stated is included here).  
  - Number and type of data disks depend on the VM size.  
- OS disk:  
  - Maximum capacity of 4 GB (as per transcript).  
  - Contains the boot volume and OS.  
- Temporary disk:  
  - Not a managed disk.  
  - Used for short-term storage such as page or swap files.  
  - Data can be lost during maintenance or redeployment but persists after normal reboots.  
  - Typically mounted as `/dev/sdb` on Linux.  
  - Assigned to the D: drive on Windows.  
- Encryption: These disks are not encrypted with Storage Encryption (SE) unless host-level encryption is enabled.  

**Examples**  
- Viewing disk roles by spinning up a Windows 10 Pro server VM and checking Disk Management to see OS disk, temporary disk, and data disk.  
- Temporary disk mount points: `/dev/sdb` on Linux and D: drive on Windows.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember the three disk roles and their purposes: OS disk (boot and OS), data disk (persistent application data), and temporary disk (ephemeral storage).  
- Temporary disk data is not guaranteed to persist through maintenance or redeployment—do not store critical data here.  
- Data disks are managed and attached as SCSI drives with configurable drive letters.  
- OS disk contains the boot volume and is essential for VM operation.  
- Encryption is not enabled by default on these disks unless host-level encryption is configured—important for security considerations.  
- Practical exam tip: Knowing the typical mount points and drive letters for temporary disks on Linux and Windows can help in troubleshooting or configuration questions.

### Managed Disk Snapshots Managed Custom Image

**Timestamp**: 05:35:42 – 05:37:07

**Key Concepts**  
- Managed disk snapshots and managed custom images are related but serve different purposes.  
- Snapshots are read-only, crash-consistent, point-in-time copies of a single managed disk.  
- Managed custom images capture all managed disks attached to a VM (OS and data disks) as a single image.  
- Snapshots exist independently of the source disk and can be used to create new managed disks.  
- Snapshots are billed based on the used size of the disk, not the allocated size.  
- Managed custom images are necessary when coordination of multiple disks is required (e.g., disk striping).  
- Snapshots do not support coordination between multiple disks.  

**Definitions**  
- **Managed Disk Snapshot**: A read-only, crash-consistent full copy of a single managed disk stored as a standard disk, used for point-in-time recovery.  
- **Managed Custom Image**: An image that contains all managed disks (OS and data disks) associated with a VM, used to capture the entire VM disk configuration.  

**Key Facts**  
- Snapshots are billed only for the used space (e.g., if a 24 GB disk uses 10 GB, billing is for 10 GB).  
- Snapshots are suitable for copying individual disks (e.g., a single data disk).  
- Managed custom images are required when multiple disks need to be captured together for scenarios like striping.  
- Snapshots do not support multi-disk coordination.  

**Examples**  
- Use snapshots to copy a single data disk.  
- Use managed custom images when you need to capture all disks of a VM together.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember that snapshots are disk-level, point-in-time copies and are independent of the source disk.  
- Snapshots are cost-efficient as billing is based on used space, not total disk size.  
- Use managed custom images when you need to capture the entire VM disk setup, including OS and multiple data disks.  
- Snapshots cannot coordinate multiple disks, so they are not suitable for multi-disk scenarios like striping.  
- Understand when to choose snapshots vs. managed custom images based on your backup or deployment needs.

### Disk Types

**Timestamp**: 05:37:07 – 05:40:35

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure managed disks come in four tiers, each with different performance and cost characteristics.  
- Disk tiers affect throughput, IOPS, latency, and VM compatibility.  
- Disk bursting allows temporary performance boosts for IOPS and throughput without permanently upgrading disks.  

**Definitions**  
- **Ultra Disk**: High throughput, high IOPS, and consistently low latency disk storage for Azure VMs. Suitable for data-intensive workloads (e.g., SAP HANA, top-tier databases, transaction-heavy workloads). Only usable as data disks and supported on specific VM series. Performance can be dynamically changed without VM restart.  
- **Premium SSD**: High-performance, low-latency disks designed for mission-critical workloads requiring guaranteed IOPS and throughput. Compatible only with premium storage-supported VM series. Provides low single-digit millisecond latency.  
- **Standard SSD**: Cost-effective storage optimized for workloads needing consistent performance but lower IOPS than Premium SSD. Suitable for web servers, low IOPS app servers, lightly used enterprise apps, and dev/test workloads. Provides single-digit millisecond latency with better availability and reliability than HDD.  
- **Standard HDD**: Lowest cost tier, reliable but with variable latency, IOPS, and throughput. Suitable for latency-insensitive workloads. Available for all VMs and regions.  

**Key Facts**  
- Ultra Disk supports dynamic performance scaling without VM restart but only as data disks.  
- Premium SSD guarantees IOPS and throughput; standard tiers do not guarantee IOPS.  
- Typical max IOPS values to remember:  
  - Premium SSD starts at ~20,000 IOPS  
  - Ultra Disk can go up to 160,000 IOPS  
- Maximum disk size across tiers is roughly 32,767 GB.  
- Maximum throughput examples:  
  - Standard HDD: lower throughput, variable performance  
  - Premium SSD: up to 900 MB/s  
  - Ultra Disk: up to 2,000 MB/s  
- Standard HDD designed for write latency under 10 ms and read latency under 20 ms for most I/O operations.  
- Bursting allows temporary increase in disk IOPS and throughput to handle unexpected traffic without upgrading disk tier. Bursting on disks and VMs are independent features.  

**Examples**  
- Ultra Disk recommended for SAP HANA, top-tier databases, and transaction-heavy workloads.  
- Premium SSD recommended for mission-critical applications requiring guaranteed performance.  
- Standard SSD suitable for web servers, low IOPS app servers, dev/test environments.  
- Standard HDD used by small startups or for non-critical, latency-insensitive workloads.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember the four disk tiers: Ultra Disk, Premium SSD, Standard SSD, Standard HDD, each with distinct performance and cost profiles.  
- Premium SSD starts at ~20,000 IOPS — a key number to recall for exams.  
- Ultra Disk offers the highest performance but limited VM compatibility and only as data disks.  
- Standard HDD is the lowest cost but with variable and higher latency, suitable for less critical workloads.  
- Use bursting to handle temporary spikes in disk performance without upgrading permanently.  
- Always check VM compatibility before selecting Ultra Disk or Premium SSD tiers.  
- Choose disk tier based on workload criticality, performance needs, and cost constraints.

### Bursting

**Timestamp**: 05:40:35 – 05:41:48

**Key Concepts**  
- Bursting is a performance feature for both virtual machines (VMs) and disk storage.  
- It temporarily boosts performance metrics such as IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) and throughput (MB/s) for disks, and CPU utilization for VMs.  
- Bursting helps handle unexpected spikes in disk or VM workload without needing to permanently upgrade resources.  
- Bursting for disks and VMs operate independently but can be combined depending on use case.  

**Definitions**  
- **Bursting (Disks)**: Temporary increase in disk IOPS and throughput to handle sudden increases in disk traffic.  
- **Bursting (VMs)**: Temporary boost in CPU performance and related resources for virtual machines.  

**Key Facts**  
- Burstable VMs require specific VM series that support bursting: VSV2, DS3, and ESV3 series.  
- Bursting is enabled by default on VMs that support it.  
- For premium SSD disks, bursting is available and enabled by default on disk sizes P20 and smaller, across all regions.  

**Examples**  
- None explicitly mentioned beyond the VM series and disk size specifications.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand that bursting is a cost-effective way to handle workload spikes without permanent upgrades.  
- Know which VM series support bursting (VSV2, DS3, ESV3).  
- Remember bursting is enabled by default on supported VMs and disks (premium SSDs P20 and smaller).  
- Bursting on disks and VMs are independent features; you can have one without the other.  
- Useful for exam scenarios involving performance optimization and cost management in Azure environments.

- Azure Disk Encryption uses BitLocker for Windows and DMcrypt for Linux to encrypt OS and data disks.  
- Three main disk roles: OS disk, Data disk, and Temporary disk.  
- Temporary disks provide short-term storage, are not managed disks, and data may be lost during maintenance or VM redeployment.  
- Managed disk snapshots are read-only, crash-consistent full copies used for point-in-time recovery and billed based on used size.  
- Managed custom images can capture all managed disks (OS + data) of a VM for reuse.  
- Azure offers four disk performance tiers: Ultra, Premium SSD, Standard SSD, and Standard HDD, each optimized for different workload needs.

**Definitions**  
- **Azure Managed Disks**: Block-level storage volumes managed by Azure, used as VM disks with built-in replication for durability.  
- **Data Disk**: Managed disk attached to a VM to store application or user data; size and number depend on VM size.  
- **OS Disk**: The managed disk containing the operating system and boot volume of a VM; max capacity mentioned as 4 GB (likely a transcript error, typically larger).  
- **Temporary Disk**: Non-managed disk providing ephemeral storage for page or swap files; data may be lost on maintenance or redeployment.  
- **Managed Disk Snapshot**: Read-only, crash-consistent full copy of a managed disk used for backup or creating new disks.  
- **Managed Custom Image**: Image capturing all managed disks (OS + data) of a VM for creating new VMs with the same configuration.  
- **Server-Side Encryption (SSE)**: Default encryption for managed disks using platform-managed or customer-managed keys.

- Up to 50,000 managed disks per subscription per region.  
- Temporary disks are typically mounted as `/dev/sdb` on Linux and `D:` drive on Windows.  
- Temporary disks are not encrypted by default with SSE unless encryption at the host is enabled.  
- Snapshots are billed based on the actual used size, not the provisioned size (e.g., 64 GB disk with 10 GB used billed for 10 GB).  
- Four disk tiers:  
  - **Ultra Disk**: High throughput, high IOPS, low latency for demanding workloads.  
  - **Premium SSD**: High performance and low latency for IO-intensive workloads.  
  - **Standard SSD**: Cost-effective with consistent performance at lower IOPS.  
  - **Standard HDD**: Low-cost, reliable for latency-insensitive workloads.  

**Examples**  
- Temporary disk usage: storing page or swap files; data loss possible during maintenance.  
- Snapshot billing example: 64 GB disk with only 10 GB used is billed for 10 GB snapshot size.  
- Encryption example: Windows VMs use BitLocker; Linux VMs use DMcrypt for disk encryption.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Know the three disk types and their roles: OS disk (boot volume), data disk (application data), temporary disk (ephemeral storage).  
- Understand the difference between snapshots (single disk) and managed custom images (multiple disks).  
- Remember that temporary disks are not backed up or encrypted by default and data can be lost on maintenance.  
- Be familiar with the four disk tiers and their use cases to select the right disk type for workload needs.  
- Snapshots are cost-efficient as they are billed on used space, not provisioned size.  
- Azure Disk Encryption differs by OS: BitLocker for Windows, DMcrypt for Linux.  
- RBAC can be applied specifically to managed disks for fine-grained access control.  
- Managed disks integrate with availability sets and zones to ensure high availability and durability.

### Intro

**Timestamp**: 06:06:20 – 06:08:47

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure Application Gateway is a load balancer operating at OSI Layer 7 (Application Layer).  
- It performs application-level routing based on HTTP requests.  
- Application Gateway can inspect HTTP request contents such as URL paths, cookies, and apply Web Application Firewall (WAF) policies.  
- Configuration involves setting up a frontend, routing rules, and backend pools.  
- Frontend IP can be either private (internal load balancer) or public (external load balancer).  
- Backend pools are collections of resources (VMs, VM scale sets, IP addresses, domain names, app services, possibly on-premises).  
- Routing rules connect frontend listeners to backend pools and define how traffic is forwarded.  
- Listeners monitor specified ports and IPs for incoming traffic using defined protocols.  
- Routing rules come in two types:  
  - Basic: forwards all requests to a backend pool regardless of domain.  
  - Multi-site: forwards requests to different backend pools based on host headers or host names.  
- Priority/order of routing rules matters; basic rules should be last to avoid capturing all traffic prematurely.

**Definitions**  
- **Application Gateway**: Azure’s Layer 7 load balancer that routes HTTP requests based on application-level information.  
- **Frontend**: The IP configuration (public or private) that receives incoming traffic for the Application Gateway.  
- **Backend Pool**: A group of resources (VMs, scale sets, IPs, etc.) that receive traffic from the Application Gateway.  
- **Listener**: Component that listens on a specific port and IP for incoming traffic using a specified protocol.  
- **Routing Rule**: Logic that connects frontend listeners to backend pools and determines how requests are forwarded.  
- **Basic Routing Rule**: Forwards all requests to a single backend pool.  
- **Multi-site Routing Rule**: Routes requests to different backend pools based on host headers or host names.

**Key Facts**  
- Application Gateway operates at OSI Layer 7 (Application Layer).  
- Frontend IP options:  
  - Private IP → internal load balancer  
  - Public IP → external load balancer  
- Backend pools can include VMs, VM scale sets, IP addresses, domain names, app services, and possibly on-premises resources.  
- Routing rules must be prioritized; basic rules should be last in order.

**Examples**  
- Routing based on URL path:  
  - Requests with path `/payments` routed to payment system VM.  
  - Requests with path `/admin` routed to admin VM.  
- Applying WAF policies to filter malicious HTTP traffic.  
- Backend pools containing various resource types to receive traffic.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand that Application Gateway is a Layer 7 load balancer focused on HTTP traffic inspection and routing.  
- Know the difference between frontend IP types and their impact (internal vs external load balancer).  
- Be able to explain backend pools and what resources they can contain.  
- Remember the two types of routing rules (basic and multi-site) and their use cases.  
- Routing rules order is important—basic rules should be last to avoid capturing all traffic prematurely.  
- Application Gateway can apply advanced routing logic based on URL paths, host headers, cookies, and WAF policies—important for exam scenarios involving application-level traffic management.

### Routing Rules

**Timestamp**: 06:08:47 – 06:11:43

**Key Concepts**  
- Routing rules determine how incoming traffic is directed to backend pools or redirections.  
- A listener listens on a specified port, IP address, and protocol to capture traffic.  
- Routing rules are applied when listener criteria are met.  
- Two types of routing rules: Basic and Multi-site.  
- HTTP settings define how requests are handled for backend pools.  

**Definitions**  
- **Listener**: Component that listens on a specified port and IP address for traffic using a specified protocol.  
- **Routing Rule**: Logic that decides where to forward incoming requests based on listener criteria.  
- **Basic Routing Rule**: Forwards all requests for any domain to a single backend pool (catch-all).  
- **Multi-site Routing Rule**: Forwards requests to different backend pools based on host header or hostname.  
- **Backend Pool**: A collection of resources (VMs, IPs, app services, etc.) that receive traffic.  
- **HTTP Settings**: Configuration that controls how HTTP requests are handled when routed to backend pools.  
- **Redirection**: HTTP redirection response (e.g., 403, temporary, permanent) instead of forwarding to backend.  

**Key Facts**  
- Basic routing rules should be placed last in priority because they catch all traffic.  
- Backend port is usually 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS), depending on where SSL termination occurs.  
- Cookie-based affinity keeps user sessions on the same backend server by persisting cookies.  
- Connection draining gracefully removes backend pool members during updates by waiting for existing connections to close before stopping traffic to them.  
- Request timeout specifies how many seconds the gateway waits for a backend response before timing out.  
- Override backend path allows routing requests for one URL path to a different internal path.  
- Override host name is used to modify the host header, useful for multi-tenant services like App Service or API Management.  

**Examples**  
- Basic rule acts as a catch-all and should be last in priority order.  
- Multi-site routing can forward requests based on host headers to different backend pools.  
- Override backend path example: routing requests for `/bananas` internally to `/oranges` or `/plantains`.  
- Override host name example: changing host headers for multi-tenant services requiring specific host headers.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always place the basic routing rule last to avoid it capturing all traffic prematurely.  
- Understand the difference between basic and multi-site routing rules for domain-based traffic routing.  
- Configure HTTP settings carefully: backend port, cookie affinity, connection draining, timeouts, and path/host overrides are critical for smooth operation.  
- Use connection draining to avoid dropping user connections during backend updates.  
- Use override backend path and host name features to support complex routing scenarios and multi-tenant services.  
- Remember that routing rules are central to how Application Gateway directs traffic at Layer 7 (application layer).

### AGW CheatSheet

**Timestamp**: 06:11:43 – 06:13:20

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure Application Gateway (AGW) operates at OSI Layer 7 (Application Layer) for application-level routing and load balancing.  
- AGW can have a Web Application Firewall (WAF) attached for enhanced security.  
- AGW components include:  
  - **Front-ends**: Choose IP address type (private or public).  
  - **Backend pools**: Collections of resources (VMs, VM scale sets, IP addresses, domain names, or app services) that receive routed traffic.  
  - **Routing rules**: Made up of listeners, backend targets, and HTTP settings.  
- Listeners monitor specific IP/port/protocol combinations and trigger routing rules. Two types: basic and multi-site.  
- Routing rules are processed in order; basic listeners should be added last to avoid capturing all requests prematurely.  
- Backend targets specify where traffic is routed—either to backend pools or redirections.  
- HTTP settings define how requests are handled (cookies, connection draining, ports, timeouts, etc.).

**Definitions**  
- **Azure Application Gateway**: A Layer 7 load balancer and application-level routing service in Azure.  
- **Listener**: A configuration that listens on a specific IP, port, and protocol to match incoming requests.  
- **Backend Pool**: A group of backend resources (VMs, scale sets, IPs, domain names, app services) that receive traffic from the gateway.  
- **HTTP Settings**: Configuration settings that control how the Application Gateway communicates with backend targets (e.g., cookie handling, connection draining, timeouts).  
- **Multi-site Listener**: A listener that can route traffic based on host headers for multiple sites.  
- **Basic Listener**: A simple listener that listens on a single IP and port.

**Key Facts**  
- AGW operates at OSI Layer 7 (application layer).  
- Backend pools can include: VM, VM scale set, IP address, domain name, or app service.  
- Listener types: basic and multi-site; order of rules matters (basic listeners last).  
- HTTP settings control detailed request handling (cookies, draining, ports, timeouts).  

**Examples**  
- None explicitly mentioned in this segment, but a practical note on overriding host names for multi-tenant services like App Service or API Management was referenced just before this section.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember AGW is a Layer 7 load balancer with WAF capabilities.  
- Understand the three main components: front-end IPs, backend pools, and routing rules.  
- Know the difference between basic and multi-site listeners and the importance of rule order.  
- HTTP settings are critical for managing backend communication behavior.  
- Backend pools are flexible and can include various resource types.  
- Overriding host names is important when routing to multi-tenant services (though this was just prior to the section).

## Scale Sets

---

### Intro to Scale Sets

**Timestamp**: 06:13:20 – 06:14:18

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure Scale Sets automatically increase or decrease virtual machine (VM) capacity based on demand.  
- Scale policies use host metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, network in) to trigger scaling actions.  
- Health checks and repair policies help maintain VM instance health by replacing unhealthy instances.  
- Load balancers can be associated with scale sets to distribute traffic evenly across VMs and availability zones.  
- Scale sets support scaling up to hundreds or thousands of VMs (e.g., 100 to 1,000 VMs).  

**Definitions**  
- **Azure Scale Sets**: A service that allows automatic scaling of identical VMs to match workload demand, improving availability and cost efficiency.  
- **Scale Policies**: Rules that define when and how to add or remove VM instances based on monitored metrics.  
- **Repair Policy**: Configuration that automatically replaces unhealthy VM instances within a scale set.  
- **Load Balancer**: A service that distributes incoming traffic evenly across multiple VMs to ensure high availability and reliability.  

**Key Facts**  
- Scale sets can scale to 100 or even 1,000 VMs.  
- Associating a load balancer with a scale set helps distribute VMs across multiple availability zones (AZs) for high availability.  
- Recommended practice: run application workloads in scale sets behind load balancers.  
- Running 3 VMs across 3 availability zones is a common pattern to achieve high availability.  
- Load balancer probe checks provide more robust health monitoring than scale set health checks alone.  

**Examples**  
- Example scenario: A web application behind an application load balancer experiences increased traffic, triggering the scale set to add more identical VMs automatically. When traffic decreases, VMs are removed to save costs.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand that Azure Scale Sets enable automatic VM scaling based on real-time metrics to handle variable workloads efficiently.  
- Always associate scale sets with load balancers to ensure even traffic distribution and high availability across availability zones.  
- Know that scale sets support large-scale deployments (up to thousands of VMs).  
- Remember to configure health checks and repair policies to maintain VM health and availability.  
- For exam scenarios, expect questions on how scale sets integrate with load balancers and availability zones to provide scalable and resilient infrastructure.

---

### Associate a Load Balancer

**Timestamp**: 06:14:18 – 06:15:24

**Key Concepts**  
- Associating a load balancer with Azure scale sets helps distribute virtual machines (VMs) evenly across availability zones.  
- Load balancers improve high availability by spreading VMs across multiple zones (e.g., 3 VMs across 3 availability zones).  
- Load balancer health probes provide more robust health checks than scale set health checks.  
- Two main types of Azure load balancers:  
  - Application Gateway: for HTTP/HTTPS (web traffic) load balancing.  
  - Azure Load Balancer: supports TCP and UDP network traffic.  
- Choice of load balancer depends on the OSI layer and traffic type you need to manage.

**Definitions**  
- **Load Balancer**: A service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple VMs to ensure reliability and availability.  
- **Application Gateway**: A layer 7 load balancer designed for web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS).  
- **Azure Load Balancer**: A layer 4 load balancer that handles TCP and UDP traffic.

**Key Facts**  
- Scale sets can scale up to 100 or even 1,000 VMs.  
- Best practice is to run application workloads in scale sets behind a load balancer for high availability.  
- Load balancer probes offer enhanced health monitoring compared to scale set health checks.  
- Distributing VMs across multiple availability zones (e.g., 3 VMs in 3 AZs) is recommended for high availability.

**Examples**  
- None explicitly mentioned beyond the general recommendation to run 3 VMs across 3 availability zones behind a load balancer.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always associate a load balancer with scale sets to ensure even VM distribution and high availability.  
- Understand the difference between Application Gateway (web traffic) and Azure Load Balancer (network traffic) to choose the correct load balancer type.  
- Use load balancer health probes for more reliable health checks than scale set defaults.  
- Designing for high availability means deploying VMs across multiple availability zones behind a load balancer.

### Scaling Policy

**Timestamp**: 06:15:24 – 06:18:51

**Key Concepts**  
- Scaling policies determine when to add (scale out) or remove (scale in) virtual machines in a scale set to meet demand.  
- Scaling out increases capacity by adding VM instances; scaling in decreases capacity by removing VM instances.  
- Metrics drive scaling decisions, commonly CPU usage, network in/out, disk read/write.  
- Aggregates and operators (e.g., greater than, greater than or equal to) refine when scaling triggers occur.  
- Actions specify how many VMs to add or remove, either by fixed count or percentage.  
- Scale-in policies define which VM instance to remove when scaling in (e.g., highest instance ID, newest VM, oldest VM), considering availability zones.  
- Update policies control how VM instances are updated to the latest scale set model: automatic, manual, or rolling updates.  
- Automatic OS upgrades can be enabled to safely update OS disks across instances.  

**Definitions**  
- **Scaling Out**: Adding VM instances to a scale set to increase capacity.  
- **Scaling In**: Removing VM instances from a scale set to decrease capacity.  
- **Scale-in Policy**: Rules that determine which VM instance is removed during scale-in operations.  
- **Update Policy**: Defines how VM instances receive updates to the scale set model (automatic, manual, rolling).  

**Key Facts**  
- Initial scaling policy setup uses a simple wizard focusing on CPU threshold as the metric.  
- More advanced scaling policies allow selection from built-in host metrics: CPU, network in/out, disk read/write.  
- Scaling actions can be specified as a fixed number of VMs or as a percentage increase/decrease (e.g., increase by 30% adds 3 VMs if you have 10).  
- Scale-in options include deleting the VM with the highest instance ID (default), newest VM, or oldest VM, all balancing across availability zones.  
- Update policies include:  
  - Automatic: upgrades start immediately, randomly or in order.  
  - Manual: requires manual upgrade of instances.  
  - Rolling: upgrades in batches with optional pauses.  
- Automatic OS upgrades can be enabled to ease update management by safely upgrading OS disks for all instances.  

**Examples**  
- Increasing load by 30% on 10 servers results in adding 3 additional servers.  
- Scale-in policy default deletes the VM with the highest instance ID while balancing across availability zones.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the difference between scaling out (adding VMs) and scaling in (removing VMs).  
- Know the common metrics used to trigger scaling actions and how aggregates and operators refine these triggers.  
- Remember scale-in policies affect which VM is removed and can impact availability zone balancing.  
- Be familiar with update policies and the benefits of automatic OS upgrades for scale sets.  
- Scaling policies start simple but become highly customizable after initial creation—know both basic and advanced options.

### Health Monitoring

**Timestamp**: 06:18:51 – 06:20:18

**Key Concepts**  
- Health monitoring determines if a virtual machine instance is healthy or unhealthy.  
- Health monitoring can be enabled or disabled based on needs.  
- Two modes of health monitoring: Application Health Extension and Load Balancer Probe.  
- Automatic repair policy can replace unhealthy instances by terminating and relaunching them.  

**Definitions**  
- **Health Monitoring**: A feature that checks the health status of VM instances to ensure they are functioning properly.  
- **Application Health Extension**: A mode where an HTTP/HTTPS request is sent to a specific path on the VM, expecting a specific status code (e.g., 200) to confirm health.  
- **Load Balancer Probe**: A health check mode that uses TCP, UDP, or HTTP requests through an associated load balancer to determine instance health.  

**Key Facts**  
- Application Health Extension expects a specific HTTP status code (commonly 200) to mark an instance as healthy.  
- Load Balancer Probe requires an associated load balancer and is generally more robust than the Application Health Extension.  
- Automatic repair policy is **not enabled by default**; it must be explicitly turned on.  
- When automatic repair detects an unhealthy instance, it terminates and replaces it with a new instance.  

**Examples**  
- Using a custom health check page (e.g., a dedicated “health check” endpoint) to verify instance health via Application Health Extension.  
- Load Balancer Probe checking health via TCP, UDP, or HTTP requests when a load balancer is present.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always consider enabling health monitoring to maintain VM instance reliability.  
- Prefer Load Balancer Probe mode if you have a load balancer, as it provides a more robust health check.  
- Use custom health check pages for more precise application-level health validation.  
- Remember to explicitly enable the automatic repair policy if you want unhealthy instances to be automatically replaced.  
- Health monitoring helps maintain availability and stability in scale sets by detecting and handling unhealthy instances promptly.

### Advanced Features

**Timestamp**: 06:20:18 – 06:21:22

**Key Concepts**  
- Allocation policy for scale sets to manage instance placement beyond default limits  
- Proximity placement groups to physically group Azure resources closer together within the same region  
- Single vs multiple placement groups affecting scale set size and VM distribution  

**Definitions**  
- **Allocation Policy**: A setting that allows scale sets to exceed the default limit of 100 instances, enabling scaling up to 1000 instances by managing VM placement.  
- **Proximity Placement Group**: A feature that groups Azure resources physically closer in the same region to reduce latency and improve performance, especially important for high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.  
- **Placement Group**: A logical grouping of VMs within a scale set. By default, a scale set uses a single placement group that can hold up to 100 VMs. Setting `singlePlacementGroup` to false allows multiple placement groups and scaling up to 1000 VMs.  

**Key Facts**  
- Default scale set limit: 100 instances per single placement group  
- Maximum scale set size with multiple placement groups: up to 1000 instances  
- Proximity placement groups improve latency by physically locating VMs closer together in the same Azure region  
- To scale beyond 100 VMs, allocation policy and multiple placement groups must be enabled  

**Examples**  
- None mentioned explicitly, but HPC workloads are cited as a use case for proximity placement groups due to latency sensitivity  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember that scale sets default to a single placement group limited to 100 VMs; to scale beyond this, you must disable single placement group mode and use allocation policies.  
- Use proximity placement groups when low latency and physical proximity of VMs matter, such as in HPC scenarios.  
- Understanding placement groups and allocation policies is critical for managing large-scale VM deployments in Azure.

### Scale Sets CheatSheet

**Timestamp**: 06:21:22 – 06:23:06

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure Scale Sets allow automatic scaling of VM capacity (scale out and scale in).  
- Load balancers can be associated with scale sets to evenly distribute VMs across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.  
- Scaling policies control when VMs are added or removed based on demand.  
- Scale in policies determine which VMs are removed (default, newest VM, oldest VM).  
- Update policies control how VM instances are updated to the latest scale set model (automatic, manual, rolling).  
- Health monitoring can be enabled to check VM health using application health extensions or load balancer probes.  
- Automatic repair policy can delete and replace unhealthy VM instances.

**Definitions**  
- **Scale Out**: Adding VM instances to increase capacity.  
- **Scale In**: Removing VM instances to decrease capacity.  
- **Application Health Extension**: Health monitoring method that sends HTTP requests to a specific path expecting a status 200 response.  
- **Load Balancer Probe**: Health check method using TCP, UDP, or HTTP requests to verify VM health.  
- **Automatic Repair Policy**: Automatically deletes and replaces unhealthy VM instances.

**Key Facts**  
- By default, a scale set uses a single placement group supporting up to 100 VMs.  
- Setting the scale set property `singlePlacementGroup` to false allows multiple placement groups and scaling up to 1000 VMs.  
- Load balancers help evenly distribute traffic and perform robust health checks.  
- Scale in policies options: default, newest VM, oldest VM.  
- Update policies options: automatic, manual, rolling.  
- Health monitoring modes: application health extension and load balancer probe.

**Examples**  
- None specifically mentioned beyond general usage scenarios (e.g., distributing VMs across AZs for high availability).

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember the difference between scale out (add VMs) and scale in (remove VMs).  
- Know the default VM limit per placement group (100) and how to scale beyond that (up to 1000 with multiple placement groups).  
- Understand the importance of load balancers for distributing traffic and performing health probes.  
- Be familiar with scale in policies and update policies options.  
- Health monitoring and automatic repair policies are critical for maintaining VM health and availability.

- ASE supports hosting web apps (Windows and Linux), Docker containers, mobile apps, and Azure Functions.  
- ASE is designed for workloads requiring high scale, isolation, secure network access, and high memory utilization.  
- ASE can be created multiple times within a single Azure region or across multiple regions for horizontal scaling of stateless app tiers.  
- ASE uses a specific pricing tier called the **Isolated** tier.  
- ASE apps can be secured behind upstream devices like Web Application Firewalls (WAF).  
- ASE supports deployment into availability zones using zone pinning.  
- There are two types of ASE deployments: **External ASE** and **ILB ASE (Internal Load Balancer ASE)**.  

**Definitions**  
- **App Service Environment (ASE)**: A fully isolated and dedicated Azure App Service feature that enables secure, high-scale hosting of web apps, containers, mobile apps, and functions.  
- **Isolated Tier**: The pricing tier associated with ASE, providing dedicated resources and isolation.  
- **External ASE**: ASE deployment exposing apps on an internet-accessible IP address.  
- **ILB ASE (Internal Load Balancer ASE)**: ASE deployment exposing apps only internally within a virtual network via an internal load balancer.  
- **Zone Pinning**: Deployment of ASE into specific availability zones for high availability and fault tolerance (mentioned but not defined in detail).  
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: A security device that can be used upstream to gate access to ASE apps.  

**Key Facts**  
- ASE allows hosting of multiple app types: Windows web apps, Linux web apps, Docker containers, mobile apps, and Azure Functions.  
- Multiple ASEs can be created in one or across multiple Azure regions for horizontal scaling.

### Deployment

**Timestamp**: 06:30:49 – 06:34:53

**Key Concepts**  
- Deployment is the process of pushing changes or updates from a local environment or repository to a remote environment.  
- Azure App Services offers a wide variety of deployment options, making it very flexible and powerful.  
- Deployment methods can involve direct file copying, package mounting, continuous integration, FTP, cloud sync, and container-based deployments.  
- The deployment directory for Azure App Services is typically `wwwroot` (on both Windows and Linux).  
- File lock conflicts can occur if files are replaced directly in the `wwwroot` folder during deployment, causing unpredictable app behavior.  
- Using package-based deployment (e.g., zip packages mounted as read-only) can help avoid file lock issues.  
- Kudu is the engine behind many Azure App Service deployments, supporting zip deployments, file cleanup, build processes, deployment scripts, and logs.  
- FTP deployment is supported but considered outdated; it requires credentials and an FTP client.  
- Cloud Sync deployment via Dropbox or OneDrive is possible, syncing files directly to the `wwwroot` folder.  
- Azure App Service pricing depends on the App Service Plan tier chosen, which affects features and cost.

**Definitions**  
- **Deployment**: The action of pushing changes or updates from a local environment or repository into a remote environment.  
- **ILB (Internal Load Balancer)**: Mentioned briefly as a difference in a deployment setup; it stands for Internal Load Balancer.  
- **Kudu**: An open-source engine behind Git deployments and Azure App Services, supporting zip deployments, build processes, deployment scripts, and logs.  
- **wwwroot directory**: The root directory where deployed web app files reside and run from in Azure App Services.

**Key Facts**  
- Deployment methods include:  
  - Run from package (zip mounted read-only)  
  - Zip or RAR deployment using Kudu  
  - FTP deployment  
  - Cloud Sync deployment via Dropbox or OneDrive  
  - Continuous deployment from GitHub, Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions, ARM templates, Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry, local Git repos (mentioned but not detailed)  
- The `wwwroot` directory is used for app runtime files on both Windows and Linux Azure App Service instances.  
- File lock conflicts can cause deployment failures and unpredictable app behavior if files are replaced directly in `wwwroot`.  
- Kudu supports zip deployments up to 2 GB in size.  
- FTP deployment requires an FTP endpoint, username, and password, and uses an FTP client.  
- Cloud Sync deployment creates a folder in Dropbox or OneDrive that syncs to the app’s `wwwroot`.  
- Azure App Service plans determine pricing and available features (tiers discussed after this section).

**Examples**  
- Running from a package: zip package mounted as read-only instead of copying files to `wwwroot`.  
- Zip deployment using Kudu: supports file deletions, build processes, deployment scripts, logs, and can be done via CLI, REST API, or Azure portal.  
- FTP deployment: old-school method where you connect via FTP client using credentials from the deployment center.  
- Cloud Sync deployment: syncing from Dropbox or OneDrive folders to the app’s `wwwroot` directory.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the variety of deployment options available in Azure App Services and their use cases.  
- Remember that the `wwwroot` directory is the key folder for app files, and direct file replacement can cause issues.  
- Using package-based deployment (run from package) can help avoid file lock conflicts.  
- Kudu is a critical component for zip-based deployments and continuous integration scenarios.  
- FTP deployment is supported but generally outdated; Cloud Sync via Dropbox/OneDrive is a unique but less common option.  
- Be aware that deployment size limits (e.g., 2 GB for zip deployments) and methods of deployment (CLI, REST, portal) exist.  
- Know that Azure App Service plans control pricing and features, which is important for deployment scalability and cost management.

### App Service Plan

**Timestamp**: 06:34:53 – 06:38:11

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure App Service requires an App Service Plan to determine pricing and available features.  
- App Service Plans are divided into tiers that define compute resources, scaling, and SLA.  
- There are three main tiers: Shared, Dedicated, and Isolated.  
- Each tier has sub-levels with varying compute power, memory, disk space, and scaling capabilities.  
- SLA (Service Level Agreement) availability varies by tier.  
- Some tiers have limitations on OS support (e.g., Shared tier not supported on Linux).  

**Definitions**  
- **App Service Plan**: A pricing and resource allocation model in Azure App Service that determines how much you pay and what features/resources are available for your web apps.  
- **Shared Tier**: A low-cost tier where apps share compute resources; includes Free (F1) and Shared options.  
- **Dedicated Tier**: Higher performance tiers with dedicated compute resources; includes Basic, Standard, Premium, and Premium v2/v3.  
- **Isolated Tier**: Highest tier with dedicated Azure Virtual Networks and full network isolation, designed for App Service Environments (ASE).  
- **SLA (Service Level Agreement)**: The guaranteed uptime percentage for the service (e.g., 99.95% for Dedicated and Isolated tiers).  

**Key Facts**  
- **Shared Tier**:  
  - Free (F1): 1 GB disk space, up to 10 apps on shared instance, no SLA, 60 minutes compute quota per app per day.  
  - Shared: Up to 100 apps on shared instance, no SLA, 240 minutes compute quota per app per day.  
  - Not supported on Linux; only Windows.  
- **Dedicated Tier**:  
  - Basic (B1, B2, B3): More disk space, unlimited apps, varying compute/memory/disk.  
  - Standard: Scales out to 3 dedicated instances, SLA 99.95%, 3 levels with varying resources.  
  - Premium: Scales out to 10 dedicated instances, SLA 99.95%, multiple hardware levels.  
- **Isolated Tier**:  
  - Scales to 100 instances, SLA 99.95%, full network isolation via Azure Virtual Networks.  
  - Primarily used for App Service Environments (ASE).  
- Terminology and tier names can be confusing and inconsistent.  

**Examples**  
- None explicitly mentioned for App Service Plan configuration, but the speaker references the tier names and their features.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always associate your Azure App Service with an App Service Plan to define cost and capabilities.  
- Understand the differences between Shared, Dedicated, and Isolated tiers to choose the right plan based on app needs and budget.  
- Shared tiers are limited in compute time and do not have SLA guarantees; suitable for development or testing.  
- Dedicated tiers offer better performance, scaling, and SLA, suitable for production workloads.  
- Isolated tier is for advanced scenarios requiring network isolation and large scale.  
- Shared tier is not available for Linux-based apps; Linux apps require at least Basic tier or higher.  
- Be aware that tier names and pricing can be confusing; review Azure documentation carefully before selecting.  
- SLA of 99.95% is standard for Dedicated and Isolated tiers.  
- The App Service Plan abstracts much of the infrastructure management, making it easier to deploy apps without granular resource management.

### Configure and Deploy App Service

**Timestamp**: 06:39:37 – 06:48:52

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure App Service is designed to simplify deployment of web applications, with better synergy for Windows, Python, and .NET stacks compared to others like Ruby on Rails on Linux.  
- Azure App Service requires the appropriate resource provider to be registered before use (under "web and domain registration").  
- App Service plans determine pricing and features; Linux plans do not support the free tier, unlike Windows plans.  
- Deployment slots are an advanced feature available only on paid tiers (e.g., B1 and above).  
- Deployment Center in Azure App Service allows linking to source control repositories (e.g., GitHub) for continuous deployment.  
- GitHub Actions can be used to automate deployment workflows triggered by code changes.  

**Definitions**  
- **Azure App Service**: A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering to host web applications, APIs, and mobile backends.  
- **Resource Provider**: A service in Azure that must be registered in a subscription to enable specific resource types (e.g., Microsoft.Web for App Services).  
- **Deployment Slots**: Separate deployment environments (e.g., staging, production) within an App Service to enable zero-downtime deployments.  
- **Deployment Center**: Azure portal feature to configure continuous deployment from source control to App Service.  
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD workflows integrated with GitHub repositories to automate build and deployment processes.  

**Key Facts**  
- Azure App Service resource provider is under "web and domain registration" and must be registered to use App Services.  
- App Service plan pricing example: Premium V2 tier costs approximately $0.20 USD per hour (~$146 USD/month), with regional price variations (e.g., Canada East shows CAD pricing).  
- Linux App Service plans do not support the free tier; Windows plans do.  
- Deployment slots require at least a B1 tier plan ($0.20/hr).  
- The example app used is a simple Python Flask "Hello World" app from the Azure samples GitHub repository.  
- GitHub repository branch naming may be "master" instead of "main" in some older samples.  
- Deployment via Deployment Center requires GitHub authorization and linking to a repository; a fork may be needed if the original repo is not accessible.  
- GitHub Actions workflow YAML file defines the deployment steps including checkout, Python setup, and build on Ubuntu-latest runner.  
- Deployment is triggered by code changes; no deployment occurs until a commit is made.  

**Examples**  
- Deploying a Python Flask app from the Azure-samples GitHub repo: `github.com/azuresamples/python/docs/helloworld`  
- Using Deployment Center to connect to GitHub, authorize, fork the sample repo, and configure deployment from the "master" branch.  
- GitHub Actions workflow automates deployment steps on push to the repository.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always verify the Azure App Service resource provider is registered before creating App Services.  
- Understand the pricing and feature differences between Linux and Windows App Service plans, especially regarding free tiers and deployment slots.  
- Deployment Center is the primary Azure portal tool for configuring continuous deployment from GitHub.  
- GitHub Actions is the underlying mechanism for automated deployments; be familiar with the workflow YAML file structure.  
- For exam scenarios, know how to link an App Service to a GitHub repo, authorize access, and trigger deployments via commits.  
- Be aware that some sample repos may use "master" branch naming, which can affect deployment configuration.  
- Deployment slots require a paid tier; free tiers do not support this feature.  
- If authentication issues arise with GitHub, creating a new GitHub account or forking the repo can be a workaround.

### Trigger a Deploy via Github Actions

**Timestamp**: 06:48:52 – 06:56:24

**Key Concepts**  
- Deployment via GitHub Actions requires a workflow YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory specifying build and deployment steps.  
- A deployment is triggered by committing changes to the specified branch (e.g., `main`).  
- GitHub Actions runs on Ubuntu latest environment and includes steps like checkout, Python setup, build, and deploy.  
- After committing a change, the GitHub Actions workflow runs automatically and can be monitored via logs.  
- If the deployed app does not serve correctly, troubleshooting involves SSH into the deployment instance to check running processes and ports.  
- Python apps often run with Gunicorn as the WSGI server; configuration is needed to bind Gunicorn to the correct port (usually port 80).  
- A `startup.txt` file can be added to the repo to configure Gunicorn with commands to bind the app to port 80 and specify worker count.  
- Committing the `startup.txt` triggers a new deployment with the correct startup configuration.  
- To verify deployment success, make a visible code change (e.g., change a string in `app.py`), commit, and confirm the change reflects on the live site.  
- Deployment slots and advanced features require upgrading the Azure App Service plan from Basic to Standard or Premium tiers.

**Definitions**  
- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub that automates workflows such as building, testing, and deploying code based on repository events.  
- **Workflow YAML file**: A configuration file in `.github/workflows` that defines the steps and environment for GitHub Actions to execute.  
- **Gunicorn**: A Python WSGI HTTP server used to serve Python web applications in production.  
- **Startup.txt**: A configuration file containing commands to start the app server correctly (e.g., binding Gunicorn to port 80).  
- **Deployment slots**: Feature in Azure App Service allowing staging and production environments for zero-downtime deployments, requiring a higher service tier.

**Key Facts**  
- GitHub Actions workflow runs on `ubuntu-latest`.  
- Deployment logs show progress and duration (example: 1 minute 29 seconds for a deploy).  
- Default Flask app runs on port 5000, which is not accessible externally in Azure App Service; port 80 must be used.  
- Gunicorn needs explicit configuration to bind to port 80 and specify worker count.  
- Adding or modifying `startup.txt` triggers a new deployment.  
- Upgrading from Basic (B1) to Standard or Premium tier is required to use deployment slots.  
- Standard tier example cost mentioned: approximately $80/month.

**Examples**  
- Making a trivial change (adding a space) to trigger a deployment.  
- Using `ps aux | grep python` via SSH to check running Python/Gunicorn processes.  
- Running `curl localhost` on the instance to verify if the app is responding.  
- Creating a `startup.txt` file with Gunicorn command:  
  ```
  gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:80 --workers=4 app:app
  ```  
- Changing a string in `app.py` (e.g., changing displayed text to "Vulkan") to verify deployment success.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always ensure your GitHub Actions workflow YAML is correctly configured and present to automate deployments.  
- Deployment is triggered by commits to the specified branch; no manual trigger needed beyond pushing changes.  
- Monitor deployment progress and logs via GitHub Actions interface.  
- If the app does not serve correctly after deployment, SSH into the instance to debug processes and ports.  
- Configure Gunicorn (or your app server) to bind to port 80 to serve the app properly in Azure App Service.  
- Use a `startup.txt` or equivalent startup script committed to the repo to automate app startup configuration.  
- Verify deployments by making visible code changes and confirming updates on the live site.  
- Deployment slots and advanced deployment features require upgrading your Azure App Service plan beyond Basic tier.  
- Remember port 5000 (Flask default) is not accessible externally; always use port 80 for production deployments in Azure App Service.

### Create Deployment Slots

**Timestamp**: 06:56:24 – 07:07:44

**Key Concepts**  
- Deployment slots allow running different versions of an app simultaneously (e.g., production and staging).  
- Deployment slots require upgrading the Azure App Service plan from Basic (B1) to Standard or Premium tiers.  
- Each deployment slot has its own deployment configuration and code, even though some settings may be copied.  
- Separate GitHub workflows (e.g., staging.yaml) are created for deployment slots to manage deployments independently.  
- Deployment slots enable zero-downtime swapping of app versions between staging and production.  
- Traffic can be split between slots by specifying percentage traffic routing to each slot.  
- Scaling (scale up and scale out) is related but separate from deployment slots and requires Standard or higher tiers.

**Definitions**  
- **Deployment Slot**: A live app environment within the same App Service that allows testing and staging different versions of an app before swapping to production.  
- **Swap**: The process of exchanging the content and configuration of two deployment slots (e.g., staging and production) with zero downtime.  
- **Scale Up**: Increasing the size or capacity of the App Service instance (e.g., upgrading from B1 to S1).  
- **Scale Out**: Increasing the number of instances running the app to handle more traffic.

**Key Facts**  
- Deployment slots are not available on the Basic (B1) plan; must upgrade to Standard or Premium.  
- Example upgrade cost mentioned: Standard tier at about $80/month (temporarily used for demo).  
- Separate deployment workflows are created for each slot (e.g., staging.yaml for the staging slot).  
- Branches in GitHub can be used to deploy different versions to different slots (e.g., main branch for production, staging branch for staging).  
- Swapping deployment slots is zero downtime and can be done without preview if no configuration changes exist.  
- Traffic routing between slots can be split by percentage (e.g., 50% production, 50% staging).  
- Maximum instance limit mentioned for scaling is 10 instances.

**Examples**  
- Created a staging slot from production branch; initially showed default page because code was not deployed yet.  
- Created a separate GitHub branch called "staging" with different app content ("Hello Klingons") deployed to the staging slot.  
- Swapped staging slot with production slot, resulting in production showing "Hello Klingons" and staging showing previous production content.  
- Adjusted traffic routing to 50% between production and staging slots, verified by refreshing the app URL multiple times.  
- Edited app.py in different branches to demonstrate different app versions deployed to different slots.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always upgrade to Standard or Premium tier to use deployment slots.  
- Deployment slots have independent deployment pipelines; code must be deployed separately to each slot.  
- Use separate Git branches to manage different slot deployments effectively.  
- Use the swap feature to promote tested staging versions to production with zero downtime.  
- Traffic splitting allows gradual rollout/testing by directing a percentage of users to staging.  
- Understand the difference between scaling (up/out) and deployment slots; both require Standard or higher plans.  
- Familiarize yourself with managing deployment workflows in GitHub Actions for each slot.  
- Remember that some UI elements (like traffic percentage sliders) may be grayed out if not at the correct management level or during certain views.

### Scaling App Service

**Timestamp**: 07:07:44 – 07:14:02

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure App Service scaling is divided into two types: **scale up** and **scale out**.  
- **Scale up** means increasing the size (SKU) of the instance (e.g., from B1 to S1).  
- **Scale out** means increasing the number of instances to handle more load.  
- Auto-scaling can be configured based on metrics such as CPU percentage.  
- Auto-scale rules include setting minimum and maximum instance counts, metric thresholds, duration, and cooldown periods.  
- Monitoring scaling events is done via the **run history** under the monitoring tab.  
- Scaling rules can be adjusted to be more or less aggressive depending on the workload.  
- Scale down actions happen automatically based on configured rules, but may require proper setup of scale out/in rules to function as expected.

**Definitions**  
- **Scale Up**: Increasing the size or capacity of a single instance (e.g., upgrading from a smaller SKU to a larger SKU).  
- **Scale Out**: Increasing the number of instances running the application to handle increased load.  
- **Auto Scale**: Automatic adjustment of the number of instances based on predefined metrics and thresholds.  
- **Cooldown Period**: Time to wait after a scale action before another scaling action can occur, to avoid rapid fluctuations.

**Key Facts**  
- Scaling up requires at least Standard tier or above (Standard, Premium, etc.).  
- Maximum number of instances allowed for scaling out is 10 by default.  
- Auto scale rules can be based on CPU percentage; example thresholds used were 10% for scaling out and 50% for scaling down.  
- Duration for triggering scale actions can be set (e.g., 1 minute for quick response, 5 minutes to avoid transient spikes).  
- Cooldown time is typically set to 5 minutes to prevent rapid scale changes.  
- Monitoring scaling events is done through the **run history** which shows instance counts over time.

**Examples**  
- Configured auto scale to add an instance when CPU usage exceeds 10% for 1 minute, with a max of 2 instances.  
- Adjusted scaling rule duration from 1 minute to 5 minutes to reduce aggressive scaling.  
- Attempted to trigger scale down by setting CPU threshold to 50% and duration to 1 minute.  
- Observed scaling events in run history showing instance count changes.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the difference between scale up (vertical scaling) and scale out (horizontal scaling).  
- Know that auto scale requires Standard tier or higher.  
- Be able to configure auto scale rules based on metrics like CPU percentage, with appropriate thresholds and durations.  
- Remember to set cooldown periods to avoid rapid scaling fluctuations.  
- Use the monitoring run history to verify scaling events and troubleshoot scaling behavior.  
- Scaling down may require proper scale out/in rule configuration to work correctly.  
- Practical exam scenarios may test your ability to configure and interpret auto scale settings in Azure App Services.

### Backup VM using Images

**Timestamp**: 07:16:53 – 07:23:27

**Key Concepts**  
- Creating managed images from virtual machines (VMs) to back them up or replicate them.  
- Using snapshots to capture the state of a VM for image creation.  
- Two main ways to create images:  
  - Managed images (standalone)  
  - Shared Image Gallery (SIG) images with versioning and replication features.  
- Importance of stopping the VM during image capture to avoid inconsistent states.  
- Zone resilience option for images to enable deployment across availability zones.  
- Differences between general and specialized images in SIG.  
- Using images to quickly create new VMs with pre-configured settings.  

**Definitions**  
- **Managed Image**: A snapshot-based image of a VM that can be used to create new VMs; created by capturing the VM’s disk state.  
- **Shared Image Gallery (SIG)**: A service that stores and manages VM images with versioning, replication, and sharing capabilities across regions and subscriptions.  
- **Zone Resilience**: A feature that allows an image to be deployed across multiple availability zones for higher availability.  
- **Generalized Image**: An image prepared for reuse where the VM has been generalized (e.g., using sysprep on Windows or waagent -deprovision on Linux), requiring a new hostname and configuration on deployment.  
- **Specialized Image**: An image capturing the VM exactly as is, including machine-specific information; no need for reconfiguration on deployment.  

**Key Facts**  
- VM must be stopped to create a managed image to ensure consistency.  
- Zone resilience should be enabled on images if you want to deploy VMs in any availability zone.  
- Creating an image from a VM can be done via the Azure portal’s “Capture” option.  
- Shared Image Gallery images require an image definition and versioning (e.g., version 0.0.1).  
- Shared Image Gallery is the preferred method for image management due to version control and replication.  
- Creating a VM from an image is straightforward: select the image and Azure pre-populates the VM creation form.  
- Images can be created with or without placing them in a shared image gallery.  

**Examples**  
- Created a Linux VM named “Wolf” running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Apache installed via custom data (bash script).  
- Captured an image of the “Wolf” VM twice: once as a standalone managed image (not in SIG) and once in the Shared Image Gallery.  
- Demonstrated creating a VM from both types of images.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always stop the VM before capturing an image to avoid inconsistent snapshots.  
- Use Shared Image Gallery for better image management, including versioning and replication across regions.  
- Enable zone resilience on images if you want to deploy VMs across availability zones.  
- Understand the difference between generalized and specialized images and when to use each.  
- Creating a VM from an image is simple and useful for backups, scaling, or disaster recovery.  
- Remember that images can be created via the VM “Capture” button or directly through the Images or Shared Image Gallery services.  
- For exam scenarios, expect questions on image creation, image types, and benefits of using Shared Image Gallery.

### Review Availability Sets

**Timestamp**: 07:23:27 – 07:26:03

**Key Concepts**  
- Availability Sets are critical for ensuring high availability of VMs by distributing them across fault domains and update domains.  
- Fault domains represent physical hardware racks that can fail independently.  
- Update domains represent groups of VMs that can be updated or rebooted at the same time without affecting others.  
- Availability Sets help maintain service uptime during planned maintenance or hardware failures.  
- Availability Zones physically separate resources within an Azure region for higher availability.  
- Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) relate to availability but have automatic scaling and default fault/update domain settings.

**Definitions**  
- **Availability Set**: A logical grouping of VMs that ensures VMs are distributed across multiple fault domains and update domains to avoid single points of failure.  
- **Fault Domain**: A physical unit of failure, such as a rack of servers, where hardware failures can affect all VMs in that domain.  
- **Update Domain**: A group of VMs that can be updated or rebooted simultaneously during planned maintenance without impacting other update domains.  
- **Availability Zone**: Physically separate locations within an Azure region to increase fault tolerance.  
- **Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)**: A group of identical, load-balanced VMs with automatic scaling capabilities, typically defaulting to 5 fault domains and 5 update domains.

**Key Facts**  
- Availability Sets require specifying the number of fault domains and update domains when created.  
- Scale Sets default to 5 fault domains and 5 update domains.  
- Availability Sets do not support automatic scaling; all VMs are identical in the set.  
- Availability Zones provide physical separation within a region, enhancing availability beyond fault/update domains.  
- Exam questions may ask how to achieve specific SLA percentages (e.g., 99.5%) using combinations of availability sets, scale sets, and zones.

**Examples**  
- None explicitly demonstrated; the instructor references a graphic showing racks (fault domains) and update domains to illustrate VM distribution and update scheduling.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand how fault domains and update domains work together in Availability Sets to maintain uptime.  
- Know the difference between Availability Sets and Scale Sets, especially regarding scaling and default domain counts.  
- Be familiar with Availability Zones as a higher-level physical separation option within regions.  
- Be prepared for exam questions on SLAs requiring knowledge of how to combine these availability features to meet uptime requirements.  
- When creating an Availability Set, you must specify fault and update domains; for Scale Sets, these are defaulted.  
- Availability Sets are foundational knowledge for AZ-900 and essential for administrator-level exams.

### Create a Scale Sets

**Timestamp**: 07:26:03 – 07:31:07

**Key Concepts**  
- Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) allow you to deploy and manage a set of identical VMs.  
- Scale sets support automatic scaling and availability across multiple availability zones.  
- Scale sets can be created from existing images, such as those in a Shared Image Gallery.  
- Scaling policies can be manual or automatic based on metrics like CPU usage.  
- Health monitoring and automatic repair can be enabled to maintain instance health.  
- Upgrade policies and over-provisioning settings control how scale sets update and manage instances.  

**Definitions**  
- **Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)**: A group of identical, load-balanced VMs that can automatically scale to meet demand.  
- **Availability Zones**: Physically separate locations within an Azure region to increase availability and fault tolerance.  
- **Scaling Policy**: Rules that determine how and when the number of VM instances in a scale set increases or decreases.  
- **Health Monitoring**: A feature that checks the health of VM instances and can trigger automatic repairs.  
- **Over-provisioning**: Creating more VM instances than requested initially to speed up deployment, which can be controlled to avoid unexpected billing.  

**Key Facts**  
- Default availability zones for scale sets are typically set to 3 for enterprise-grade availability.  
- Initial VM instance count can be set manually; example used was 3 instances matching 3 availability zones.  
- Scaling policies can be set to manual or based on metrics such as average CPU percentage.  
- Health monitoring can be configured on specific ports (e.g., port 80 for web servers).  
- Automatic repair replaces unhealthy instances after a configurable grace period (example: 10 minutes).  
- Upgrade policies control how and when VM instances are updated or replaced.  
- Over-provisioning is enabled by default but can be turned off to prevent unexpected charges.  

**Examples**  
- Created a scale set named "Wolf Scale Set" using an image from the Shared Image Gallery.  
- Set the scale set to use 3 availability zones and an initial instance count of 3.  
- Used manual scaling to increase instances from 1 to 3.  
- Enabled health monitoring on port 80 and automatic repair with a 10-minute grace period.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Always use 3 availability zones for enterprise-scale VM scale sets to ensure high availability.  
- Use Shared Image Gallery images to simplify scale set creation.  
- Understand the difference between manual and automatic scaling policies; automatic scaling can be based on CPU or other metrics.  
- Enable health monitoring and automatic repair to maintain VM instance health and availability.  
- Be aware of upgrade policies and over-provisioning settings to control costs and update behavior.  
- Manual scaling is straightforward for exam scenarios, but know how to configure auto scaling rules as well.  
- Remember that scale sets integrate with load balancers or application gateways for traffic distribution (covered in next sections).

### Create an Application Gateway

**Timestamp**: 07:31:07 – 07:37:36

**Key Concepts**  
- Application Gateway is a type of load balancer operating at Layer 7 (application layer).  
- Azure Load Balancers operate at Layer 4 (transport layer - TCP/UDP).  
- Application Gateway is suitable for web applications requiring HTTP/HTTPS routing and advanced traffic management.  
- Setting up an Application Gateway involves configuring frontend IP, backend pools, listeners, HTTP settings, and routing rules.  
- Subnets must be dedicated for the Application Gateway within the virtual network.  
- Backend pools can include virtual machine scale sets, but they must be in the same virtual network.  
- After adding a scale set to the backend pool, the scale set instances may require an upgrade for changes to take effect.  
- Health probes can be configured to monitor backend instance health via custom paths (e.g., /healthcheck).

**Definitions**  
- **Application Gateway**: A Layer 7 load balancer in Azure that manages web traffic by routing HTTP/HTTPS requests based on URL paths, host headers, and other application-level information.  
- **Load Balancer (Azure Load Balancer)**: A Layer 4 load balancer that distributes traffic based on TCP/UDP protocols without inspecting application-level data.  
- **Backend Pool**: A group of backend servers (VMs or scale sets) that receive traffic from the Application Gateway.  
- **Listener**: A configuration that listens for incoming traffic on a specified frontend IP and port.  
- **HTTP Settings**: Configuration that defines how the Application Gateway communicates with backend servers, including port, cookie-based affinity, and connection draining.  
- **Health Probe**: A mechanism to monitor the health of backend instances by periodically sending requests to a specified path.

**Key Facts**  
- Application Gateway requires a dedicated subnet within the virtual network (e.g., subnet named "VGW" with address range 10.0.2.0/24).  
- Recommended to have at least three instances for availability (rule of three).  
- Frontend IP can be public or private; in this example, a public IP named "Wolf VGW" was created.  
- Backend pool was linked to a virtual machine scale set named "Wolf skill set."  
- Listener configured for HTTP on port 80 with a single frontend IP.  
- HTTP settings used port 80, no cookie-based affinity or connection draining enabled for this simple app.  
- Scale set instances must be upgraded after adding them to the backend pool for the changes to apply.  
- Health probes can be customized to check specific URLs like "/healthcheck" for backend health monitoring.

**Examples**  
- Web application: Simple Apache page served via Application Gateway.  
- Virtual network used: "WolfVNet 499" with a dedicated subnet "VGW" created for the Application Gateway.  
- Backend pool linked to a VM scale set named "Wolf skill set."  
- Listener named "mylistener" configured for HTTP port 80 on public frontend IP.  
- HTTP settings named "my HTTP settings" with default port 80 and no advanced options enabled.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the difference between Azure Load Balancer (Layer 4) and Application Gateway (Layer 7) and when to use each.  
- Always create a dedicated subnet for the Application Gateway within the virtual network.  
- Ensure backend pools and Application Gateway are in the same virtual network to avoid configuration issues.  
- Remember to upgrade VM scale set instances after adding them to the backend pool to activate changes.  
- Configure listeners and HTTP settings carefully to match your application requirements (e.g., port, protocol, cookie affinity).  
- Use health probes to monitor backend health and improve application availability.  
- For exam scenarios, be prepared to identify components of Application Gateway and troubleshoot common issues like subnet conflicts or scale set upgrades.

- Functions in Kusto come in several types: stored functions, query-defined functions, and built-in functions.  
- Stored functions are user-defined and managed as database schema entities.  
- User-defined functions are categorized into scalar functions and tabular functions.  
- Query-defined functions exist only within the scope of a single query.  
- Built-in functions are hard-coded by Kusto and cannot be modified by users.  
- Built-in functions include special functions (to select entities), aggregate functions (to perform calculations like count), and window functions (operate on multiple rows, e.g., row_number).  
- Scalar operators work with scalar data types and include byte-wise operators (binary AND, NOT, OR, shifts, XOR) and logical operators (equality, inequality, AND, OR).

**Definitions**  
- **Stored Functions**: User-defined functions stored and managed as part of the database schema.  
- **Scalar Functions**: Functions that take scalar inputs and return scalar outputs.  
- **Tabular Functions**: Functions that take tabular inputs and return tabular outputs (multiple rows).  
- **Query-Defined Functions**: User-defined functions limited to the scope of a single query.  
- **Built-in Functions**: Predefined, hard-coded functions by Kusto that provide utility and cannot be changed by users.  
- **Aggregate Functions**: Functions that perform calculations on sets of values and return a single value (e.g., count).  
- **Window Functions**: Functions that operate on multiple rows, often used for ranking or row numbering (e.g., row_number).  
- **Byte-wise Operators**: Operators that manipulate bits (AND, NOT, OR, shift left/right, XOR).  
- **Logical Operators**: Operators for logical comparisons (equals, not equals, AND, OR).

**Key Facts**  
- Stored functions are managed as database schema entities.  
- Scalar functions handle single values; tabular functions handle tables (multiple rows).  
- Query-defined functions differ from stored functions by their limited scope (single query).  
- Built-in functions cannot be modified by users.  
- Aggregate functions return a single value from multiple inputs.  
- Window functions can assign row numbers or perform calculations across rows.  
- Byte-wise operators require knowledge of binary math but are available if needed.

**Examples**  
- Using `.show tables` to list tables and count them (mentioned as a control command example).  
- Aggregate function example: `count()` to count rows or values.  
- Window function example: `row_number()` to assign row numbers within query results.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the different types of functions in Kusto and their scope (stored vs query-defined vs built-in).  
- Remember scalar vs tabular functions and their input/output types.  
- Built-in functions are essential utilities but cannot be changed.

- Numerical operators work on integers, longs, and reals with arithmetic and modulus operations.  
- String operators often have negated forms indicated by an exclamation mark (!).  
- Between operators check if a value falls within an inclusive range.

**Definitions**  
- **Byte-wise operators**: Operators that work on binary data using bitwise logic such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR, shift left, and shift right.  
- **Logical operators**: Operators for boolean logic and comparisons, e.g., equals (=), not equals (!=), AND, OR.  
- **Date/time arithmetic operators**: Operators that add, subtract, multiply, or divide date and time values or time spans.  
- **Numerical operators**: Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) and modulus (%) for numeric types like int, long, and real.  
- **String operators**: Operators that perform operations on string values, often with negated versions using !.  
- **Between operator**: Checks if a value lies inclusively between two other values (e.g., between 1 and 10).

**Key Facts**  
- Byte-wise operators include: binary AND, NOT, OR, XOR, shift left, shift right.  
- Modulus operator (%) determines divisibility and remainder (e.g., 17 % 2 returns 1 because 17 is not divisible by 2).  
- Logical operators include equals, not equals, less than, greater than, less or equal, greater or equal.  
- String operators have negated variants prefixed with an exclamation mark (!).  
- Between operator works with numbers and date/time ranges inclusively.

**Examples**  
- Modulus example: `17 % 2` returns 1 (since 17 is not divisible by 2).  
- Between example: `between 1 and 10` or `between these date times` to check if a value falls within that range.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the different categories of scalar operators and their purposes.  
- Remember that byte-wise operators manipulate bits and are useful if you know binary math.  
- Logical and numerical operators are fundamental for comparisons and arithmetic in queries.  
- The modulus operator is useful for checking divisibility.  
- String operators often have negated forms using `!`—know this for filtering conditions.

- Many tabular operators have direct analogues in SQL, making them easier to understand if you have SQL experience.  

**Definitions**  
- **Count**: Returns the total number of rows in a table.  
- **Take**: Returns up to a specified number of rows from the table (similar to SQL’s LIMIT).  
- **Sort**: Orders rows by one or more columns, e.g., sorting by a property descending.  
- **Project**: Selects a specific set of columns from the table (similar to SQL’s SELECT).  
- **Where**: Filters rows based on a predicate condition.  
- **Top**: Returns the first N records sorted by specified columns; a shorthand combining take and sort.  
- **Extend**: Creates a new column by computing a value based on existing columns (e.g., `duration = endtime - starttime`).  
- **Summarize**: Aggregates groups of rows, similar to SQL’s GROUP BY.  
- **Render**: Outputs results as graphical visualizations.  

**Key Facts**  
- Tabular operators work on sets of rows, enabling powerful data manipulation and analysis in KQL.  
- Operators like take, sort, project, and where have direct SQL equivalents, aiding learning and application.  
- The top operator simplifies the combination of take and sort into a single step.  
- Extend allows creation of calculated columns for further use in queries.  
- Summarize is essential for aggregation and grouping data.  
- Render is used to visualize query results graphically within Kusto.  

**Examples**  
- Sorting rows by a damage property in descending order (`sort by damage desc`).  
- Creating a new column `duration` by subtracting `starttime` from `endtime` using extend (`extend duration = endtime - starttime`).  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the core tabular operators as they form the backbone of querying in KQL.  
- Remember the SQL analogies to help recall operator functions:  
  - take ≈ limit  
  - sort ≈ order by  
  - project ≈ select  
  - summarize ≈ group by  
- Use top for quick retrieval of sorted subsets of data.  
- Use extend to add computed columns for richer data analysis.  
- Summarize is critical for aggregation tasks.  
- Render is useful for producing visual outputs directly from queries.  
- Focus on these common operators rather than trying to memorize all tabular operators.

- Target resources emit signals (metrics, logs, activity logs, application insights) that alerts evaluate.  
- Criteria or logical tests determine if an alert should be triggered (e.g., CPU usage > 70%).  
- Action groups define what actions to take when an alert triggers (e.g., run automation, call webhooks).  
- Alert states track the lifecycle of an alert, with system-set monitor conditions and user-set alert states (e.g., marking an alert as closed).

**Definitions**  
- **Alert Rule**: A configuration that specifies the resource to monitor and the conditions under which an alert is triggered.  
- **Signal**: Data emitted by a resource, such as metrics, logs, or activity logs, used to evaluate alert criteria.  
- **Criteria / Logical Test**: The condition(s) evaluated against signals to determine if an alert should be triggered.  
- **Action Group**: A collection of actions (automation runbooks, Azure Functions, ITSM, Logic Apps, Webhooks) executed when an alert fires.  
- **Monitor Condition**: The alert state set automatically by the system indicating the current status of the alert.  
- **Alert State**: The status set by the user to track the alert lifecycle (e.g., active, acknowledged, closed).

**Key Facts**  
- Alerts can be triggered based on metrics, logs, or activity logs.  
- Actions on alert trigger can include automation runbooks, Azure Functions, ITSM integrations, Logic Apps, Webhooks, and Secure Webhooks.  
- Monitor condition is system-controlled; alert state is user-controlled for tracking resolution status.

**Examples**  
- Example of a criteria: CPU percentage greater than 70%.  
- Example actions: running an automation runbook or triggering a Logic App.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the three types of Azure alerts and their data sources.  
- Know the components of an alert: alert rule, signal, criteria, and action group.  
- Remember that alerts help proactively detect and resolve issues before impacting users.  
- Be familiar with how alert states work for tracking and managing alerts.  
- Know common actions that can be automated when an alert triggers.  
- While detailed alert state management may not be exam-critical, understanding the overall alert workflow is important.

- ACI is a fully managed Docker-as-a-service, removing the need to manage underlying VMs.  
- Containers can be provisioned in seconds vs. minutes for VMs.  
- Containers are billed per second; VMs are billed per hour.  
- Containers support granular/custom sizing of vCPU, memory, and GPUs; VM sizes are fixed.  
- ACI supports both Windows and Linux containers.  
- Persistent storage in ACI is achieved by mounting external volumes, commonly Azure Files.  
- Containers are stateless by default; state persistence requires external volume mounts.  
- Container groups are collections of containers scheduled on the same host, sharing lifecycle, network, and storage resources.  
- Container groups are similar to Kubernetes pods but are not the same.  
- Multi-container groups currently support only Linux containers.  
- Deployment of multi-container groups can be done via ARM templates (for complex deployments) or YAML files (for container-only deployments).  
- Container restart policies: **Always**, **Never**, and **OnFailure**.  
- Environment variables (including secured environment variables) can be passed to containers via portal, CLI, or PowerShell.  
- CLI commands for troubleshooting: `az container logs`, `az container attach`, `az container exec`, and `az monitor metrics list`.  

**Definitions**  
- **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**: A service to launch containers in Azure without managing underlying VMs, designed for isolated containers running simple apps, task automation, or build jobs.  
- **Container Group**: A set of containers deployed on the same host machine that share lifecycle, network, and storage resources.  
- **Restart Policies**: Rules defining when a container should restart:  
  - **Always**: Restart container regardless of exit status (ideal for services/web servers).  
  - **Never**: Run container once and do not restart (ideal for background jobs/tasks).  
  - **OnFailure**: Restart container only if it exits with an error.  
- **Environment Variables (nVars)**: Key-value pairs passed to containers for configuration; can be secured to avoid exposure of sensitive data.  

**Key Facts**

### AKS

**Timestamp**: 08:45:19 – 09:13:36

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes as a Service offering by Azure.  
- AKS manages the Kubernetes master components (control plane), health monitoring, and maintenance.  
- Users are responsible only for managing the agent nodes (worker nodes).  
- AKS service itself is free; you only pay for the agent nodes.  
- AKS supports advanced features during deployment such as advanced networking, Azure AD integration (RBAC), monitoring, and Windows Server containers.  
- AKS is suitable when full container orchestration is needed: service discovery, automatic scaling, coordinated application upgrades.  
- Bridge to Kubernetes is a Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code extension that allows developers to debug microservices locally while connected to an AKS cluster.  
- Kubernetes clusters in Azure require registration of the Kubernetes resource provider before use.  
- Azure CLI (`az`) and `kubectl` are primary tools for managing AKS clusters and Kubernetes resources.  
- Deployments can be created using pre-built container images (e.g., NGINX, HTTPD/Apache).  
- Pods can be scaled using `kubectl scale` to increase replicas.  
- Node pools can be scaled using `az aks scale` to increase the number of nodes.  
- Kubernetes resources and cluster management can be done via Azure Portal, CLI, or YAML/JSON configuration files.  
- Cleaning up involves deleting deployments, pods, and the AKS cluster to avoid unnecessary costs.

**Definitions**  
- **AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)**: A managed Kubernetes service in Azure where the control plane is managed by Azure and users manage only the agent nodes.  
- **Agent Nodes**: Worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster that run containerized applications.  
- **Bridge to Kubernetes**: A Visual Studio/VS Code extension that enables local development and debugging of microservices connected to an AKS cluster by proxying traffic.  
- **kubectl**: Kubernetes command-line tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters.  
- **Node Pool**: A group of nodes within an AKS cluster that share the same configuration.  
- **Load Balancer Service**: A Kubernetes service type that exposes an application externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.

**Key Facts**  
- AKS control plane (masters) is free; only agent nodes incur cost.  
- Recommended node count for production: 3 nodes; for development: 1 node.  
- Minimum node VM size requirements: at least 2 cores and 4 GB memory.  
- Default node size DS2 v2 costs approximately $136/month; smaller sizes cost less but may not meet minimum requirements.  
- Scaling pods example: increasing replicas from 1 to 3 using `kubectl scale deployment <name> --replicas=3`.  
- Scaling nodes example: increasing node count to 3 using `az aks scale --resource-group <rg> --name <cluster> --node-count 3`.  
- After deployment, services can be exposed with type LoadBalancer to get an external IP address for public access.  
- Azure Portal may have delays or inconsistencies in reflecting real-time cluster status; CLI verification is recommended.

**Examples**  
- Creating an AKS cluster named "Borg" in resource group "Borg" with 1 node for development.  
- Deploying NGINX using: `kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx`  
- Exposing NGINX deployment with: `kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer`  
- Deploying Apache HTTPD using: `kubectl create deployment httpd --image=httpd`  
- Scaling HTTPD deployment to 3 pods: `kubectl scale deployment httpd --replicas=3`  
- Scaling AKS node pool to 3 nodes: `az aks scale --resource-group Borg --name Borg --node-count 3`  
- Cleaning up by deleting deployments (`kubectl delete deployment nginx` and `kubectl delete deployment httpd`) and deleting the AKS cluster from Azure Portal or CLI.

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember AKS control plane is free; cost is only for agent nodes.  
- Always register the Kubernetes resource provider before creating AKS clusters.  
- Use Azure CLI (`az aks`) and `kubectl` commands for cluster and workload management.  
- Know how to deploy container images, expose services, and scale pods and nodes.  
- Use Bridge to Kubernetes extension for efficient local debugging of microservices within AKS.  
- Verify cluster and node status via CLI due to possible Azure Portal delays.  
- Clean up resources after use to avoid unnecessary charges.  
- Understand the difference between pod scaling (replicas) and node scaling (worker nodes).  
- For exam scenarios, focus on AKS architecture, cost model, deployment basics, and scaling commands.

### DNS

**Timestamp**: 09:13:36 – 09:30:07

**Key Concepts**  
- DNS (Domain Name System) resolves domain names to IP addresses.  
- Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains using Microsoft Azure infrastructure.  
- Two types of Azure DNS zones: Public DNS (internet-facing) and Private DNS (internal-facing).  
- DNS Zone: container for all DNS records of a specific domain.  
- DNS Record: a rule that directs where to send a domain name; composed of name, type, and value.  
- Record Sets: groupings of DNS records; Azure DNS always uses record sets even if only one record exists.  
- Time To Live (TTL): duration other servers cache DNS records before querying again.  
- Azure Alias record type: special record that points directly to Azure resources, preventing dangling domains.  

**Definitions**  
- **Domain Name**: A service that translates and resolves a service name to its IP address.  
- **Azure DNS**: A Microsoft Azure service that hosts DNS domains and provides name resolution.  
- **DNS Zone**: A container holding all DNS records for a specific domain.  
- **DNS Record**: A rule with a name, type, and value that directs domain traffic.  
- **Record Set**: A collection of DNS records grouped together; Azure DNS creates record sets rather than individual records.  
- **TTL (Time To Live)**: The time period DNS records are cached by other servers before refreshing.  
- **Alias Record**: Azure-specific DNS record type that points directly to Azure resources (e.g., VMs, load balancers), automatically updating if the resource changes.  
- **Public DNS**: DNS zone accessible over the internet for managing internet-facing domains.  
- **Private DNS**: DNS zone used internally within Azure for custom domains instead of Azure provider domains.  

**Key Facts**  
- Azure DNS does **not** provide domain registration services; domains must be purchased elsewhere (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap) and then managed via Azure DNS.  
- Common DNS record types to know:  
  - **A**: Points domain to IPv4 address.  
  - **AAAA**: Points domain to IPv6 address.  
  - **CNAME**: Canonical name alias from one domain to another.  
  - **MX**: Mail exchange records for email routing.  
  - **NS**: Name server records for DNS delegation and redundancy.  
  - **PTR**: Pointer record for reverse DNS lookup.  
  - **SRV**: Service locator records (e.g., for Active Directory).  
  - **TXT**: Text records used for verification and documentation (e.g., domain ownership verification).  
  - **SOA**: Start of Authority record containing administrative info about the domain.  
- TTL should be set low for records that change frequently or require failover to reduce caching delays.  
- Wildcard records (e.g., `*`) can be used to catch all subdomains; Azure supports wildcard subdomain matching like `*.subdomain`.  
- The `@` symbol in DNS records is shorthand for the root (naked/apex) domain.  
- Azure Alias records work with A, AAAA, and CNAME types and should be used whenever possible to avoid manual updates when Azure resource IPs or hostnames change.  

**Examples**  
- Creating a public DNS zone named `wharf.com` in Azure DNS.  
- Setting an A record pointing `site.wharf.com` to a VM’s public IP address.  
- Using an alias record to point `site2.wharf.com` directly to the Azure VM resource, avoiding dangling IP issues if the VM’s IP changes.  
- Creating a CNAME record to alias `google.warf.com` to `google.com`.  
- Creating child DNS zones for subdomains like `app.wharf.com` or multi-tenant subdomains like `mytenant1.app.wharf.com`.  
- TXT record example: used by Gmail to verify domain ownership by adding a specific TXT value.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Remember Azure DNS is for managing DNS records, **not** for purchasing domains.  
- Know the difference between public and private DNS zones in Azure.  
- Understand DNS zones, records, and record sets — Azure always uses record sets.  
- Be familiar with common DNS record types (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, SRV, TXT, SOA).  
- Use TTL wisely: low TTL for frequently changing records or failover scenarios; longer TTL reduces DNS query load.  
- Always prefer Azure Alias records when pointing to Azure resources to avoid stale or dangling DNS entries.  
- Know the meaning of special DNS record naming conventions: `@` for apex domain, `*` for wildcard subdomains.  
- Practical knowledge of creating DNS zones, records, and alias records in Azure is useful but exam focus is on concepts and record types.

- **Network Watcher**: Azure service providing tools for monitoring, diagnosing, and viewing network metrics and logs.  
- **Network Performance Monitor (NPM)**: A cloud-based solution to monitor network performance and detect issues like traffic blackholing and routing errors.  

**Key Facts**  
- Azure VNets can have multiple address spaces (unlike AWS VPCs which have one).  
- Each subnet requires a route table; Azure provides default system routes including internet access.  
- User-defined routes can override default routes, e.g., setting internet route hop to "None" to create private subnets.  
- There are four hop types for routes: Virtual Network Gateway, Virtual Network Internet, Virtual Appliance (e.g., firewall VM), and None.  
- Five IP addresses are reserved per subnet: network address, Azure default gateway, two for Azure DNS and VNet space, and broadcast address.  
- VNet peering types:  
  - Regional Peering: between VNets in the same Azure region  
  - Global Peering: between VNets in different Azure regions  
- Azure Firewall uses a static public IP for outbound traffic identification and integrates with Azure Monitor.  
- ExpressRoute Direct supports bandwidth from 50 Mbps up to 10 Gbps for hybrid scenarios requiring high throughput and low latency.  
- Network Watcher is disabled by default per region and must be enabled manually.  
- NSG security rules have properties: name, source/destination (IP, CIDR, service tag), port range, protocol (TCP/UDP/ICMP), action (allow/deny), and priority (100-4096).  

**Examples**  
- Creating a private subnet by overriding the default internet route with hop type "None" in a user-defined route table.  
- Attaching multiple NICs to an Azure VM for network communication.  
- Using Private Link endpoints with private IPs to connect securely to Azure services or third-party marketplace services.  
- Setting up Azure Firewall in its own subnet and routing subnet traffic through it using a user-defined route with hop type "Virtual Appliance" pointing to the firewall’s private IP.  
- Testing VNet peering connectivity using PowerShell’s `Test-NetConnection` cmdlet between VMs in peered VNets (regional and global).  
- Using Network Watcher tools like IP Flow Verify, NSG Diagnostic, Packet Capture, and NSG Flow Logs for network troubleshooting and monitoring.

### NSG

**Timestamp**: 10:53:41 – 11:00:44

**Key Concepts**  
- Network Security Groups (NSGs) filter network traffic to and from Azure resources within a Virtual Network (VNet).  
- NSGs consist of multiple security rules that control inbound and outbound traffic.  
- Rules specify source, destination, port range, protocol, action (allow/deny), and priority.  
- NSGs are stateful, meaning return traffic is automatically allowed without explicit rules.  
- NSGs can be applied at the subnet level and/or the Network Interface Card (NIC) level.  
- When NSGs are applied at both subnet and NIC levels, rules are evaluated first at the subnet, then at the NIC. Both must allow traffic for it to pass.  

**Definitions**  
- **Network Security Group (NSG)**: A set of security rules that filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in a VNet.  
- **Security Rule**: A rule within an NSG that defines traffic filtering based on source, destination, port, protocol, action, and priority.  
- **Stateful**: NSGs track active connections (flow records), allowing return traffic automatically without needing explicit inbound/outbound rules for the response.  
- **Flow Record**: A record created for existing connections that helps NSGs maintain statefulness by tracking connection states.  

**Key Facts**  
- Each security rule has:  
  - Unique name  
  - Source and destination (IP address, CIDR block, service tag, application group)  
  - Port range (single port, range, or all ports with *)  
  - Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP)  
  - Action (Allow or Deny)  
  - Priority (number between 100 and 4096; lower numbers processed first)  
- Two types of rules: inbound (traffic entering NSG) and outbound (traffic leaving NSG).  
- Default NSG rules:  
  - Inbound: Allow traffic from any virtual network, allow Azure Load Balancer, deny all else.  
  - Outbound: Allow traffic to any virtual network and internet, deny all else.  
- Limits:  
  - Up to 5,000 NSGs per subscription.  
  - Up to 1,000 security rules per NSG.  
- You cannot create two rules with the same priority and direction.  
- NSG rules are processed in priority order, from lowest number to highest.  
- NSGs are stateful: specifying an outbound rule automatically allows the inbound response, and vice versa.  
- Removing a security rule does not immediately interrupt existing connections; flows are interrupted only after no traffic flows for a few minutes.  
- If no NSG is assigned to subnet or NIC, all traffic is allowed (not recommended).  
- When NSG is applied only to NIC, rules behave predictably based on allow/deny.  
- When NSGs are applied to both subnet and NIC, both must allow traffic for it to pass (e.g., port 80 must be open on both).  

**Examples**  
- Scenario: Virtual machine with NIC but no NSG assigned → all traffic allowed.  
- Scenario: NSG assigned to NIC only → traffic filtered according to NSG rules on NIC.  
- Scenario: NSG assigned to subnet and NIC → traffic must be allowed by both NSGs; if subnet blocks port 80 but NIC allows it, traffic is blocked.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand the components of an NSG rule: name, source/destination, port range, protocol, action, priority.  
- Remember NSGs are stateful; you don’t need to create both inbound and outbound rules for response traffic.  
- Know default inbound and outbound rules created by Azure NSGs.  
- Priority numbers matter: lower numbers are processed first. No duplicate priority numbers allowed in same direction.  
- NSGs can be applied at subnet and NIC levels; both sets of rules are evaluated, and both must allow traffic.  
- Always have NSGs applied to at least subnet or NIC to avoid unrestricted traffic.  
- Be familiar with limits on NSGs per subscription and rules per NSG for exam context.  
- Review diagrams/slides on NSG application scenarios (subnet vs NIC) as they are important for exam understanding.

### Virtual WAN

**Timestamp**: 11:00:44 – 11:12:38

**Key Concepts**  
- Azure Virtual WAN is a consolidated networking service combining networking, security, and routing functionalities into a single operational interface.  
- It supports branch connectivity, site-to-site VPN, remote user VPN (point-to-site), intra-cloud connectivity, ExpressRoute, internet routing, and Azure Firewall encryption for private connectivity.  
- Virtual WAN is essentially Azure’s implementation of Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN).  
- SD-WAN decouples CPU-intensive router tasks (management, operation, control plane) from physical devices and centralizes control virtually.  
- SD-WAN enables more efficient, cost-effective routing over the internet compared to traditional MPLS networks.  
- Points of Presence (POPs) are network edge entry points, typically ISP data centers, used to connect to networks.  
- A "hop" refers to moving from one POP/network to another during data transit.  
- MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) is a private network routing method using labels instead of IP addresses to forward packets efficiently.  
- MPLS is outsourced to service providers, uses specialized hardware (Label Switch Routers - LSRs), and offers guaranteed performance but is expensive and lacks inherent encryption.  
- SD-WAN can replace MPLS by routing over the internet with HTTPS security, offering cost savings and easier configuration at scale.  
- Azure Virtual WAN hubs are VNets with service endpoints at region edges that connect on-premises networks to Azure cloud resources via virtual devices.  

**Definitions**  
- **Azure Virtual WAN**: A unified networking service that integrates multiple networking, security, and routing features into a single interface, enabling efficient cloud and branch connectivity.  
- **Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN)**: A WAN architecture that centralizes control of network traffic routing by decoupling management and control functions from physical routers, enabling optimized and secure internet-based connectivity.  
- **Point of Presence (POP)**: An entry point at the edge of a network, such as an ISP data center, where devices connect to the network.  
- **Hop**: The act of moving data packets from one POP or network to another during transmission.  
- **MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching)**: A packet forwarding technique using labels to determine the shortest path through a private network, managed by service providers using specialized hardware (LSRs).  
- **Label Switch Router (LSR)**: A network device in MPLS that reads labels on packets to forward them along predetermined paths.  
- **Virtual Network Gateway**: A software VPN device deployed in Azure VNets that enables secure connectivity between Azure and on-premises or other networks.  

**Key Facts**  
- Azure Virtual WAN supports multiple connectivity types: branch, site-to-site VPN, point-to-site VPN, ExpressRoute, intra-cloud, internet routing, and Azure Firewall encryption.  
- MPLS is considered OSI Layer 2.5 because it inserts a label (shim) between Layer 2 and Layer 3 in packets.  
- MPLS offers traffic engineering and quality assurance but is costly and lacks encryption.  
- SD-WAN uses HTTPS for secure communication over the internet.  
- SD-WAN offers cost-effectiveness and simpler configuration compared to MPLS, especially at scale.  
- Azure has many POPs globally, enabling fast and efficient routing to Microsoft services like Office 365.  
- Virtual WAN hubs are VNets with service endpoints configured at region edges to optimize connectivity.  

**Examples**  
- Connecting an office to another branch or data center over the internet involves multiple POP hops through different ISPs (e.g., Bell, Rogers, Vodafone, AT&T, NTT).  
- MPLS example: Using a private network with Label Switch Routers to forward packets efficiently between office and branch.  
- Office 365 access example: Instead of routing through MPLS and partner data centers, SD-WAN routes traffic directly to the nearest Microsoft POP for faster and cheaper access.  

**Key Takeaways 🎯**  
- Understand that Azure Virtual WAN is a comprehensive SD-WAN solution integrating multiple networking features for cloud and branch connectivity.  
- Know the difference between MPLS and SD-WAN: MPLS is private, expensive, and hardware-dependent; SD-WAN is internet-based, cost-effective, and centrally managed.  
- Remember that POPs and hops are fundamental concepts in network routing and are critical to understanding WAN traffic flow.  
- SD-WAN improves performance and reduces costs by routing traffic over the internet using HTTPS and leveraging Azure’s global POPs.  
- Virtual WAN hubs (VNets with service endpoints) are key components for connecting on-premises networks to Azure efficiently.  
- For exam scenarios, be prepared to explain why SD-WAN is preferred over MPLS in modern cloud architectures.  
- Virtual Network Gateways are essential for VPN connectivity in Azure and involve deploying specialized VMs in a gateway subnet.

### VNGs

**Timestamp**: 11:12:38 – unknown

**Key Concepts**  
- Virtual Network Gateway (VNG) is the software VPN device for Azure Virtual Networks (VNets).  
- VNGs enable secure connections between Azure VNets and on-premises networks or individual devices.  
- VNG deployment involves creating a gateway subnet and deploying two or more specialized VMs running routing tables and gateway services.  
- Gateway types determine whether the gateway is a VPN gateway or an ExpressRoute gateway.  
- VPN gateways support multiple connection topologies: site-to-site, multi-site, point-to-site, and VNet-to-VNet.  
- VPN gateways use IPsec tunnels for secure connections over the internet.  
- ExpressRoute is an alternative to VPN gateways but requires more complex setup and uses edge partners instead of the public internet.

**Definitions**  
- **Virtual Network Gateway (VNG)**: The software VPN device deployed in Azure VNets that manages VPN connections by deploying specialized VMs in a gateway subnet.
