# Section Merge Task

Merge these partial notes into ONE coherent, comprehensive section.

## Section: {section_title}

## Partial Notes from Different Transcript Chunks

{partials}

## Merge Instructions

### CRITICAL: Timestamp Validation

- Calculate the time span: [latest end] - [earliest start]
- If the span is > 30 minutes, something is WRONG - the partials may be from different topics
- In that case, keep ONLY the content that most directly relates to the section title
- Reasonable timestamp spans: 1-15 minutes for most sections

### Output Format (REQUIRED)

You MUST output in this EXACT format:

### {section_title}

**Timestamp**: [earliest start] – [latest end]

**Key Concepts**

- [merged concepts as bullet points]

**Definitions**

- **[Term]**: [definition]

**Key Facts**

- [merged facts]

**Examples**

- [merged examples]

**Key Takeaways 🎯**

- [merged tips]

### Merge Rules

1. **Key Concepts**: Combine all bullet points, remove exact duplicates, keep near-duplicates if they add nuance
2. **Definitions**: Keep the most complete definition for each term
3. **Key Facts**: Remove redundant facts, keep unique ones
4. **Examples**: Keep ALL unique examples (high value for exams)
5. **Key Takeaways**: Combine tips, prioritize actionable ones

### Quality Rules

- Do NOT add information not in the source partials
- Do NOT summarize or lose detail
- Every section MUST have a **Timestamp** line
- Omit subsections that have no content (don't write "None")
